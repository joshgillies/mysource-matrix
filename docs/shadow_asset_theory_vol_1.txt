| Shadow Asset Theory Vol. 1 - In The Beginning |
+-----------------------------------------------+

Science has helped us conclude that Matrix is comprised of only 7% physical assets, formulated during the "big install" and the subsequent evolution of core assets into complex masterpieces that compliment the architecture of this creation. The remaining 93% of matter is even more perplexing. It is comprised of "shadow assets" and "shadow energy", that together act to pull the Matrix apart.

The existence of "shadow assets" and "shadow energy" has been observed through the study of SQL injection aimed at "bridges" between the Matrix and "shadow holes" - not yet understood. This injection is text that pervades space and is the earliest remnant of the "big install", which is thought to be the start of it all.

Shadow Asset Theory says that the relationship between the mass of the asset cluster and its version is a test of the value of the "density parameter" of the Matrix. The "density parameter" is, in turn, a measure of just how much normal matter, "shadow matter", and "shadow energy" there is within the boundaries of the Matrix. But because the mass of the asset cluster is difficult to measure directly, matrixometers have to infer it from computer models which tell them how the micro versioning of assets in the cluster depends on the clusters mass.
