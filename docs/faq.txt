| WYSIWYG EDITOR |
+----------------+

Q. Why is my toolbar still disabled when my popup window closes?
A. You may have popup blocker software interfering with the contents of the popup. The google toolbar is a known culprit. Try allowing popups from the editing URL. For example, if you edit through the URL test.com/_edit - configure your popup blocking software to allow popups from the URL test.com.

Q. How do I add a new package to Matrix ?
A. You will first have to initialise the repository and then import the package.

Go to the root directory of the package (eg. cd /mysource_matrix/packages/PACKAGE)
Now initialise the repository (eg. cvs -d /home/cvs/mysource_matrix/packages/PACKAGE init)
Now import the package (eg. cvs -d /home/cvs/mysource_matrix/packages/PACKAGE import -m "Package description" PACKAGE squiz start)

Once that is done you will need to setup the new respository correctly by editing some of the files in the CVSROOT, so wherever you have all the other CVSROOT's checked out (you do have them don't you?) do this :

  cvs -d /home/cvs/mysource_matrix/packages/PACKAGE co -d PACKAGE CVSROOT

This will checkout the CVSROOT dir into a dir called PACKAGE

Once there you will need to modify and commit these files (the changes to make should be copied from another package) :
  config
  cvswrappers
  loginfo

There may be some other differences in file between the CVSROOTS, but at the moment these are just diff's in comments that are generated when you do the 'cvs init' (obviously changes from a newer version of CVS)

Then add the repository to Chora by editing /home/websites/default/htdocs/horde/chora/config/cvsroots.php on beta (as it stands at the moment)

You will now have to checkout the package for yourself. The directory you imported is not a working version at the moment.
So, back out of the directory back to the packages directory, rename your PACKAGE directory, then check out the working version.
  cd ../
  mv PACKAGE PACKAGE_import
  cvs -d /home/cvs/mysource_matrix/packages/PACKAGE co PACKAGE

If everything looks fine in your checked out version, go ahead and remove the import directory - you wont need it any more.

And the last thing that you need to do is to checkout the package in the phpdocs directory.
So on beta go to /home/htdocs/mysource_matrix_phpdoc/mysource_matrix/packages (as it stands at the moment) and run the same checkout command as you did for your own version.

  cd /home/htdocs/mysource_matrix_phpdoc/mysource_matrix/packages
  cvs -d /home/cvs/mysource_matrix/packages/PACKAGE co PACKAGE
  chgrp -R cvsusers PACKAGE
  chmod -R g+w PACKAGE

Once it has been checked out it will be updated automatically by the cron script.

Q. How do I add a new directory to Fudge ?
A. You cant just add the directory, you need to import it.

Go to the directory (eg. cd /mysource_matrix/fudge/DIR)
Now import the directory (eg. cvs -d /home/cvs/fudge import -m "Dir description" DIR squiz start)

You will now have to checkout the fudge directory for yourself. The directory you imported is not a working version at the moment.
So, back out of the directory back to the mysource matrix root directory, rename your DIR directory, then check out the working version.
  cd ../../
  mv fudge/DIR fudge/DIR_import
  fudge_co

The fudge_co script will check out your new imported directory.

| SYSTEM ADMIN    |
+-----------------+

Q. What things do I need to do when I move/copy a system from one place to another ?
A. There are several steps :

  ########################################################################################################################
  If you are moving the system from one server to another then there is one check that you need to do first.
  Run this command on both the old and the new servers :
       php -r 'var_export(get_defined_constants());' | grep \'CRYPT_

  Output should be something like this :
      'CRYPT_SALT_LENGTH' => 12,
      'CRYPT_STD_DES' => 1,
      'CRYPT_EXT_DES' => 0,
      'CRYPT_MD5' => 1,
      'CRYPT_BLOWFISH' => 0,

  Now if there is a difference between any of these values there could be a problem with logging in on the new system.
  See http://www.php.net/crypt for more info

  Basically if there is a difference then you will most likely have to reset everyone's passwords
  ########################################################################################################################

  1. Create a backup with backup.sh in the current root directory, just in case :)

  2. Copy everything under the system root from the old area to the new area

  3. Create the new database, if applicable, and copy the existing data to it

  4. Edit the [NEW SYSTEM ROOT]/data/private/conf/main.inc, alter :
       - SQ_CONF_DB_DSN and SQ_CONF_DB2_DSN if the database has changed
       - SQ_CONF_PEAR_PATH if this has changed
       - SQ_CONF_SYSTEM_ROOT_URLS if any root urls have changed

  5. Run [NEW SYSTEM ROOT]/scripts/system_move_update.php to update all the file version information

  6. If you are running the HIPO Jobs through the Squiz Server, then you will need to update the server config, 
     and get that re-read by the server. You may also need to edit [NEW SYSTEM ROOT]/data/private/conf/squiz_server.inc
     if any of these settings have changed

  7. If the Cron Jobs are running then the crontab entry will need to be edited/added for the new system root.
     ****NOTE**** - You will need to reset the Epoch of the Cron Manager to the time that this new crontab 
                    entry will be first run.

  8. WYSIWYG & HTML Tidy - If moving to a new server, then you will need to make sure that the HTML Tidy is
     installed on the server and the WYSIWYG plugin is pointing to the correct place

That should be it, have fun
