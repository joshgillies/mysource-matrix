    <string source="ecom_promotional_rule_type_quantity_section_note">This rule defines the discount amounts based on the number of assets/items being purchased. The asset quantity will be ordered by ascending automatically. It is supposed that the more assets being purchased, the more discount is given so that the total amount can be calculated correctly. For example, the asset quantity/discount amount pairs are 2/5, 3/9 and 10/50. If the currency unit is pound, it can be read as "buy 2 assets get 5 pounds discount (2.5 pounds discount for each asset), buy 3 get 9 pounds discount (3 pounds discount for each asset) and buy 10 get 50 pounds discount (5 pounds discount for each asset)". If there are 14 assets being purchased, they will be split to 10 + 3 + 1 instead of 10 + 2 + 2 because the rule for the more assets is taken into account first. So the discount amount for 14 assets are 50 + 9 = 59 pounds instead of 50 + 5 + 5 = 60 pounds. To have the correct calculation, you will need to add more thresholds like 4/10 (for 2+2) and 6/18 (for 3+3 instead of 2+2+2). But the better discount strategy should be "the asset quantity of the higher threshold is more than twice of the lower threshold". For example, you can use 2, 5 (greater than 2*2) and 11 (greater than 5*2) for the asset quantities. So 2/5, 5/15, and 11/55 are good thresholds.</string>
