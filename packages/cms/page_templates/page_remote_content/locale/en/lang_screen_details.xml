	<section name="Content Filtering">
		<field attribute="start_tag">
			<display_name>Start Tag</display_name>
			<note>
			Content on the remote page will be discarded until this tag is reached. You can use standard HTML elements or define your own tag to use (for examle <![CDATA[&lt;&#33;-- START --&gt;]]>).
			</note>
		</field>
		<field attribute="end_tag">
			<display_name>End Tag</display_name>
			<note>After the Start Tag has been encountered, all the content on the remote page will be captured until this tag is reached. You can use standard HTML elements or define your own tag to use (for examle <![CDATA[&lt;&#33;-- END --&gt;]]>). If this tag is not found, everything is captured till the end of page.</note>
		</field>
		<field attribute="no_tag_clear">
			<display_name>When Tag(s) Not Found</display_name>
			<note>This option can be used to determine what is displayed when Start and End Tags are configured for content filtering, but are not present in the remote content.</note>
		</field>
		<field attribute="include_tags">
			<display_name>Include Start/End Tags?</display_name>
			<note>
			If start and end tags are specified this switch allows you to specify whether they should be included in the result.

			<display_name>Strip Images?</display_name>
			<note>If you select "Yes", all images on the target page will be removed and replaced with their Alt tag values (or word 'Image')</note>
		</field>
		<note>When filtering content based on Start/End tags, please be aware that complex nested content might not be properly identified, i.e. if there is a table inside a table and you want to capture the top level table, the captured region might start at the right spot, but end when the included table ends, without reaching the end of the top level one.
		</note>

	<section name="Content Tunneling">
		<note>By default, there is no content tunneling. All the elements of the remote page like images, flash movies, external scripts are requested by the browser from their original location. Enabling tunneling for a particular type of content means that it will be accessed not via it's original location directly, but by asking the remote content to retrieve it. This is done by re-writing the URLs of those elements to point back to the remote content asset. This feature might be beneficial if you are setting up a system with HTTP Authentication or if the target content is configured to only allow access to this matrix server. Beware that enabling these options may significantly increase the load time of the target page as well as increase the traffic of the matrix server.</note>
		<field attribute="tunnel_images">
			<display_name>Images?</display_name>
			<note>By enabling this option, all the images will be tunneled through this remote content asset.</note>
		</field>
		<field attribute="tunnel_media">
			<display_name>Media?</display_name>
			<note>Everything else that is not an image - Flash, Movies and other objects.</note>
		</field>
		<field attribute="tunnel_scripts">
			<display_name>Scripts?</display_name>
			<note>CSS, JavaScript</note>
		</field>
	</section>
	<section name="Connection Settings">
		<field attribute="timeout">
			<display_name>Timeout in seconds</display_name>
			<note>If the content cannot be retrieved within the specified period, an error message will be displayed. This value must be non-negative. If you try to submit a negative number, it will be changed to the default value.</note>
		</field>
		<field attribute="allow_redirect">
			<display_name>Allow Redirects</display_name>
			<note>If enabled, this asset will redirect to the necessary location automatically. It is important to leave this YES in the general case because many sites do silent redirects. If a redirect is required and this is set to NO, you will get an Error Message</note>
		</field>
	</section>
	<section name="HTTP Authentication">
		<note>Please note that HTTP Authentication may not properly work in the mixed content environments. This means that although this asset will be able to obtain the bare HTML page from the remote source, the images and other includes will be requested by the web browser (not this asset) so the user will be prompted to authenticate as well. To overcome this issue, you may try tunneling the content (above).</note>
		<field attribute="username">
			<display_name>User Name</display_name>
			<note>If not using HTTP authentication, leave this blank.</note>
		</field>
		<field attribute="password">
			<display_name>Password</display_name>
			<note>Password will not be shown</note>
