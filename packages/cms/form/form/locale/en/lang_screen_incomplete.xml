			<display_name>Reminder Email Format</display_name>
			<note><![CDATA[<p>This email will be sent when an incomplete submission has been in the system for longer than the <em>Send Reminder Email After</em> period. If the User that created the submission has an email address set, this email will be sent to them. You can also specify additional recipients of the email by entering valid email addresses into the <em>To:</em> field, or selecting User or User Group assets with the Asset Finder.</p>
			<p>The following keywords are available:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>%form_total_pages%</strong> - The total number of pages in the form.</li>
			<li><strong>%return_to_form_url_current%</strong> - The URL that will return the user to the form, on the <em>Current Page</em>.</li>
			<li><strong>%return_to_form_url_latest%</strong> - The URL that will return the user to the form, on the <em>Latest Page</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, the following keyword wildcards are available (where "*" is any valid keyword for the appropriate asset):</p>
			<ul>
			<li><strong>%user_asset_*%</strong> - Replaced with the value of the %asset_*% keyword for the user that owns the incomplete submission.</li>
			<li><strong>%form_asset_*%</strong> - Replaced with the value of the %asset_*% keyword for the form's parent page.</li>
			<li><strong>%submission_asset_*%</strong> - Replaced with the value of the %asset_*% keyword for the incomplete submission.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of the submission asset keywords, the most important are probably the submission's asset ID (<strong>%submission_asset_assetid%</strong>) and the current and latest pages (<strong>%submission_asset_attribute_current_page%</strong>, <strong>%submission_asset_attribute_latest_page%</strong>).</p>
