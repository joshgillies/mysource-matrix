MYSOURCE MATRIX CHANGELOG

VERSION 3.6.0 RC2

Featured Changes
----------------------

TWO STEP TRASH

	The purge trash HIPO job has been changed to improve its performance. Previously, if an asset (or tree of assets) was both within the trash and outside of it, the purge trash HIPO would still process all those assets one by one. Now, the purge trash HIPO first removes all assets that exist outside of the trash before processing the asset it needs to delete.

EXPORT CUSTOM FORM LOGS

	Previously, the submission logs of custom forms could only be exported to a file by going to a screen of the form asset. This meant that custom form submissions could not be exported in the simple editing interface because the custom form page asset did not have the ability to export its own submission logs.

	Custom form page now has a new logs screen that functions in the same way as the existing screen on the form. It also makes the fields within the screen accessible in the simple editing interface, allowing editors to access submission logs without opening the administration interface.

DESIGN AREA CACHING

	Design areas, such as menus and nested content, are often static, yet they account for quite a lot of queries during page loading. All design areas (with the exception of the BODY, SHOW_IF and LOGIN_FORM design areas) can now be cached by adding the attribute cache="1" to the design area tag in the parse file.

	All design areas that are static (ie. not random) should be cached for performance. This includes all menus, most nested content areas, all asset lineages and constant buttons. Like all other MySource Matrix caching, permissions do not stop the cache from working, so users will still see the correct contents based on their group permissions.

INSERT IMAGE PREVIEW IN WYSIWYG

	When inserting images in the WYSIWYG, both internal and external images now appear in a preview pane in the popup window. This allows you to confirm that the image you have selected is correct before inserting it.

VERSION 3.6.0 RC1

Featured Changes
----------------------

GROUPED LISTINGS

	The listing engine now has the ability to group listed assets by a common parent or metadata field. Grouping by attribute value. Grouping by attribute value has not been developed but could be added at a later date if required.

	You are able to construct as many levels of grouping as you require, but all assets will be displayed in the final level of grouping. So you can, for example, group all results by a common parent, and then group those parents by the value of a metadata field, displaying all listed assets in metadata groups.

	Grouping works for all assets that extend listing engine, so the functionality is available in the asset listing, search page and the what's new page.

500 ERROR IF DATABASE IS DOWN

	MySource Matrix now returns a 500 Internal Server Error is the database server is down when a page is requested. This allows monitoring software to detect that the database is no longer running and the MySource Matrix is no longer serving pages.

PAGINATED FORM SUBMISSIONS

	Previously, all form submission were listed on the same page in the custom form. This caused errors when a large number of form submissions (> 10,000) were being displayed. The custom form now has a paginated interface for viewing form submissions, allowing the interface to cope with an unlimited number of submission for a single form.

ASSET STATUS PANE

	While not technically new, the asset status pane at the bottom of the asset map has been put back into the beta and development versions. The asset status pane shows a description for each status colour.

ASSET MAP ADD MENU LOADS FASTER

	The add menu in the asset map previously loaded images when the add button was clicked for the first time. The loading of images actually stopped the display of the add menu, giving the impression that the java applet was running slowly while the real reason is that the asset map was requesting images.

	The asset map add menu now displays a default image while it is loading the asset type's image. This allows the add menu to now be displayed immediately.

WYSIWYG TABLE EDITOR IMPROVED

	The WYSIWYG table editor now has a number of new (widely requested) ways to edit HTML tables. While some are new pieces of functionality, the changes have been back-ported to the current stable branch to fix a number of bugs in the table editor that are stopping users from editing content.

	The new table editing functionality allows for:
	- the selection of row, cell, and column properties for modification (previously only row and cell were available)
	- there are options for the entire table such as border (both html and css), colour, caption and other functionality that was present in previous versions
	- each of the selectors now has their own panel that has the facility to edit the colour, size and border of the selected container, as well as the ability to add and delete elements
	- the table editor is now easier to use as it implements guideline borders for tables which would otherwise seem invisible

VERSION 3.5.0 Beta

Featured Changes
----------------------

SESSION TIMEOUTS

	A new feature has been added to allow user sessions within MySource Matrix to be maintained for a customisable period of time (eg. 7 days). A user is able to keep their session information (including login details and shopping basket contents) for a period of time without having to have their web browser open for the entire period. They could log into MySource Matrix, edit some content, come back in 3 days and still be logged in.

	The 3 different types of session timeout options that can be set are:
	- whether a user's session should expire when they close their browser
	- whether a user's session should expire when they've been inactive for a certain period of time
	- whether a user's session should expire if they haven't authenticated for a certain period of time

	The feature has been added as a global/group preference rather than a system wide configuration setting, so you can choose to customise session timeout options per user group if you require, or use the global preference for all users.

ORACLE SUPPORT

	A number of additional changes have been made to the MySource Matrix database schema and source code to allow MySource Matrix to run on an Oracle database. MySource Matrix can be installed and run on Oracle 9i but has not undergone thorough testing. Oracle support should be considered preliminary but one development team will be doing all new development on an Oracle database instead of PostgreSQL.

PAINT LAYOUTS

	A new concept called Paint Layouts has been added to MySource Matrix. Paint layouts are like designs for your content. You can crate a paint layout and customise how individual types of assets should look. For example, a news asset might be printed a certain way by default, but a paint layout could be created so you can define your own way it is printed. Keywords are used to place attributes and metadata values of the asset on the screen.

LOG MANAGER

	A new log manager system asset has been created to help manage the rotation of system log files. Future plans for development will allow users to use the log manager to configure custom log rotation schedules as well as view existing system logs from the administration interface.

BACKEND TRANSLATION

	The MySource Matrix backend is now multi-language capable, meaning all string and error messages can be translated into languages other than English Currently, the backend interface is only available in English, but support for other languages is planned.

ASSET MAP CHANGES

	Many changes have been made to the asset map to improve usability for larger systems and to fix some of the bugs that existed. The main new features are multiple tree support, undockable view and multiple move/clone/link operations.

TRIGGERS

	A triggering system has been added to MySource Matrix to help users complete repetitive task and to enforce system wide business rules. For example, you can configure a trigger in the system so that when Image assets are created under your site, they are automatically resized to 3 size variations, and added to the Media Folder.

	Once installed, make sure you enable triggers on the Details screen of the Trigger Manager if you want to use them.
