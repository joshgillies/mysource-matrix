MYSOURCE MATRIX CHANGELOG

VERSION 3.0.0 RC2

Featured Changes
----------------------

Cache Manager
	MySource Matrix RC2 introduces basic content caching support to improve the performance of high-load sites. Caching is turned off by default on new and existing systems. Caching can be enabled on the details screen of the cache manager.
	
	Caching is currently supported for standard pages, asset listings, site maps, and search pages. The contents of the page is cached depending on the groups the visitor exists in (if any). In the case of search results, the results of each search term are cached by the Search Manager and the look of each search results is cached by the Search Page. Search results can continue to be sorted dynamically while still maintaining the speed improvements provided by the caching system.
	
	Note that the cache for an asset is not automatically cleared each time it is changed, so some changes may not appear until the next time the cache is refreshed automatically by MySource Matrix. This time period is configurable.


Rollback Management
	Rollback management is now handled by the rollback_management.php script in the MySource Matrix scripts directory (MYSOURCE_ROT/scripts/rollback_management.php). This script allows you to enable and disable rollback within MySource Matrix, as well as clean out any old rollback entries that you no longer want to keep. For example, you can purge all rollback entries older than 2 weeks. Usage of the script can be viewed by running the script without any arguments (php scripts/rollback_management.php). The script can only be run from the command line.
	
	When enabling and disabling rollback, the flag MYSOURCE_ROOT/data/private/conf/main.inc configuration file must be changed manually to rollback on or off:
		define('SQ_CONF_ROLLBACK_ENABLED', '1'); <-- Rollback is enabled
		define('SQ_CONF_ROLLBACK_ENABLED', '0'); <-- Rollback is disabled


Added OS X Support
	MySource Matrix RC2 introduces support for OS X using Mozilla based browsers.
	
	Mozilla, Mozilla Firefox, and Camino browsers on Mac OS X run version 1.3.1 of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) by default rather than Java 1.4.x which is required by MySource Matrix. This is the case even if a Java 1.4 version is installed on the system. In order to run Java 1.4 on a Mozilla based browser you will require the Java Embedding Plugin (JEP). To install, download the plugin from http://javaplugin.sf.net/ and follow the instructions.
	
	The MySource Matrix WYSIWYG editor is not supported in Safari, so a Mozilla based browser must be used for content editing on OS X.

	More information can be found at our forums: http://forums.matrix.squiz.net/index.php?showtopic=17


Workflow Notification
	Users and groups within workflow schemas can now be notified when an asset goes live after the workflow has been completed. To configure MySource Matrix to email these notifications, a manual change has to be made to a configuration file for existing systems. New systems will already have this change.
	Edit the file MYSOURCE_ROOT/data/private/conf/messaging_service.inc and append asset.status.notify to the SQ_MS_SEND_MAIL_WHITE_LIST array. Make sure this setting is on a new line.
	
	For example:
		For an array that looks like this:
			define('SQ_MS_SEND_MAIL_WHITE_LIST', 'asset.locking.forced
			config.*
			hipo.*
			asset.workflow.invitation
			asset.workflow.announce');
		
		Change the array to look like this:
			define('SQ_MS_SEND_MAIL_WHITE_LIST', 'asset.locking.forced
			config.*
			hipo.*
			asset.workflow.invitation
			asset.workflow.announce
			asset.status.notify');


Custom CSS for Designs
	MySource Matrix now allows for much greater customisation of CSS files in design. The new CSS File asset allows you to upload a CSS parse file which is evaluated by MySource Matrix at run-time and allows for custom CSS generation. It supports all of the MySource Matrix standard design areas, though only a few are appropriate.

	The new linked CSS design area allows you to create a link from a Design to a CSS File asset:
		<MySource_AREA id_name="css_file" design_area="linked_css">
		   <MySource_SET name="tag_type" value="link_tag|import_tag" />
		   <MySource_SET name="media" value="all|aural|braille|embossed|handheld|print|projection|screen|tty|tv" />
		</MySource_AREA>

	If you set the tag_type option to 'link_tag', the following output will be generated:
		<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/link/to/file.css" media="<media value>" />

	If you set the tag_type option to 'import_tag', the following output will be generated:
		@import url(/link/to/file.css);


LDAP Permission Bug
	A bug existed in MySource Matrix RC1 that caused incorrect menus to be shown to some LDAP users when viewing a page. Users currently experiencing this problem should manually reparse all designs within their system. A design can be manually reparsed by checking the 'Manual Reparse' box on the details screen of a Design asset.
