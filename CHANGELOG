MYSOURCE MATRIX CHANGELOG

VERSION 3.26.7

Featured Changes
===================================

Keywords on Alternate Contexts Inherit Metadata on the Default Context [ Feature Request #4518 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

By default, on a system with multiple contexts, metadata on alternate contexts which has not been configured will inherit the metadata values of the System's default context. This inheritance, however, was not previously reflected through keyword replacement. Metadata keyword replacements would return no values for metadata fields that had not been manually configured on the alternate context. For example, if you have an alternate context on your system which is inheriting the default context's metadata, keyword replacements such as %asset_metadata_field%, on the alternate context would return a blank value rather than the inherited metadata.

This feature allows metadata keyword replacements to return inherited metadata on alternate contexts.

VERSION 3.26.6

Featured Changes
===================================

Funnelback Search Log Report [ Feature Request #4403 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new log report asset is now available for the Funnelback Search package, providing statistics of searches on a system. This includes details on the most popular search queries and queries which failed to return any results.

The Funnelback Search log report displays the statistics for each collection on a system, as well as a tally of the system-wide total results.

The log report can be configured to display search statistics on either a daily, weekly or monthly basis, with archived reports available on the asset's Report screen.

Word Logic for Funnelback Search [ Feature Request #4410 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Word logic options are now available on the Funnelback Search page to allocate whether searched terms should be excluded or included (any or all) from the search results. These settings can be configured on the backend or on the frontend (via user selection).

The Word Logic field, on the Details screen of the Funnelback Search page, allows you to set the default word logic for the search page.

By default, this is Include any, meaning that results will be displayed if containing at least one of the searched terms. The options Include all (all searched terms must be included in results) and Exclude (search results must not contain the search term) are also available.

The %search_logic% and %metadata_logic_X% keyword replacements can be used to display the word logic options on the frontend of your site. This allows users to define the parameters of their search themselves.


Asset Exclusions from Funnelback Indexing [ Feature Request #4474 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new Asset Exclusions screen is available on the Funnelback Manager to enable to exclusion of assets during Funnelback indexing.

Assets can be specified for exclusion by Asset ID, Type or Root Node. Please note that these exclusions extend across ALL collections. When an exclusion is added, changed or deleted, you will have to run the rebuild cache and reindexing for Funnelback to acknowledge the changes.

File Upload Questions Available For Ecommerce Form Pages [ Feature Request #4497 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature allows you to use File Upload question types on an Ecommerce Form Page enabling users with the ability to upload a file during their form submission.

The File Upload question type works the similarly to the Custom Form's File Upload question type - For more information, refer to the Custom Form manual (http://manuals.matrix.squiz.net/custom-form/chapters/file-upload-question-type).


Enable Make SOAP Call Submission Action in E-Commerce Form [ Feature Request #4498 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A Make SOAP Call submission action has been added to the Ecommerce Form Page, accessed on a new Submission Actions screen (via the Ecommerce Form Contents asset).

This submission action works in a similar manner to the existing Make SOAP Call submission action of a Custom Form (see the Custom Form manual for more information), sending a message to a remote SOAP server on the submission of a form. Question keyword replacements can be used in the SOAP request message to set form answers as parameter values.

The parameter values returned from the SOAP call are then stored as global session variables and can be printed using global keyword replacements.

VERSION 3.26.4

Featured Changes
==================================

Workflow Step: Custom Subject Line for Email Notifications (further enhancements) [ Feature Request #4268 ]
-----------------------------
An extension of this functionality previously released. The custom subject line was previously set only if the custom message had also been set.
This modification now allows the subject field can to be configured independently of the message text.


Context-awareness for Multiple Page Page Keyword Replacements [ Feature Request #4286 ]
-----------------------------
A new keyword, %current_page_attribute_name% has been provided on the outer asset as a contexted equivalent to the existing %current_page_name% keyword.
The %asset_attribute_name% keyword of inner assets now also returns page names from the current context.


Make SOAP Call Form Action [ Feature Request #4314 ]
-----------------------------
A new Form Submission Action has been added to perform SOAP requests prior to logging the submission. This action provides a template of the function call used, to populate with keywords or static values.

Keywords available for inclusion in requests are:
  - Form Question responses -> %response_123_q1%
  - Contents of File Upload responses -> %file_upload_123_q2%

Results from the called function are stored in the session sandbox and are available from %globals_session_xx% variables.


Global Keyword Replacements for Site Special Pages [Feature Request #4333]
-----------------------------
A set of Global Keywords has been introduced to return the asset ID of associated Site Special Pages. When not set, these keywords will return no result.

The new keywords are:
  - %globals_site_index_id%     : asset ID of the Index Page
  - %globals_site_not_found_id% : asset ID of the Not Found Page
  - %globals_site_archive_id%   : asset ID of the Archived Asset Page

Colon notation, as above but with a Site asset ID specified (for Site ID 123):
  - %globals_site_index_id:123%
  - %globals_site_not_found_id:123%
  - %globals_site_archive_id:123%

VERSION 3.26.3

Featured Changes
==================================

Automatic Remaps to use closest available Lookup match [ Feature Request #4217 ]
-----------------------------
Remaps are now selected to more closely match by old URL. Previously remap destination URLs were determined to be the first URL in the lookup.
This new functionality means that remaps should maintain within the same domain, as long as there is a matching URL for that domain.


Web Paths Screen: Target URL display in Remaps List [ Feature Request #4220 ]
-----------------------------
To retain consistency with Remap Manager, the Remaps section on the asset Web Paths screen now displays the Target URLs within the remaps list.


Additional MIME Types added for Microsoft Office [ Feature Request #4105 ]
-----------------------------
MIME types for Microsoft Office documents, such as those with extensions "docx" and "pptm", have been added to enable these files to be served with the expected type header.


E-Commerce Order: New Keyword for Order Total [ Feature Request #4248 ]
-----------------------------
A new keyword, %order_grand_total%, has been added to E-Commerce Order assets to expose the total amount of orders on the frontend, and for listing and grouping purposes through Listing Engine.


SOAP API be able to set asset status and create a file asset [ Feature Request #4274 ]
-----------------------------
Additional functionality to create File assets and to set their status.


Link lineage performance improvements part 2 [ Feature Request #4262 ]
-----------------------------
Performance enhancement to remove duplicate asset IDs before being included in an SQL query.
This enhancement was made to lineage code and may be noticed on systems with many links to particular assets.


Custom Workflow Subjects [ Feature Request #4268 ]
-----------------------------
The subject line of Workflow Messages sent via email can now be customised per Workflow Step. The body of these messages (eg; Invitation message) could already be customised here, so this compliments this functionality.


New Trigger Event: Matrix Cache Cleared [ Feature Request #4293 ]
-----------------------------
A new "Matrix Cache Cleared" Trigger Event is available for capture and use in Triggers whenever the cache is cleared on a particular asset.

Please note that this is not available for systems using Memcache cache storage, nor when the cache is cleared by URL or entirely, due to technical constraints with implementing this functionality.


New Trigger Action: Set Standard Asset Date [ Feature Request #4294 ]
-----------------------------
The values for standard asset date fields "Created", "Last Updated", "Published" and "Status Last Changed", may be set from within a Trigger to a fixed value or the time the Trigger was fired. One-minute resolution is provided for each of these values.

VERSION 3.26.2

Featured Changes
===================================

Funnelback Search integration [ Feature Request #4214 ]
-----------------------------
MySource Matrix has been integrated with purpose-built Funnelback binaries, for indexing and searching of content housed in a MySource Matrix system.

Searches are performed against Collections, which are linked to MySource Matrix Site assets, and Meta-Collections which comprise multiple Collections (ie; for searching more than one site at a time). Configuration of Collections, Metadata mappings and indexing are performed under the Funnelback Manager asset.

The Funnelback Search Page asset has been expanded to include bodycopies for Contextual Navigation, Type Formats (HTML, PDF etc.), Featured Pages and spelling suggestions.

Funnelback search integration is performed through interaction with external binaries. These are included within MySource Matrix SSV for configuration during installation or upgrade.

Search indexing functions differently to MySource Matrix Search, in that content is not immediately indexed when updated. Scripts are available within the Funnelback package which can be added to the cron to update the index periodically. The frequency at which the indexer should be run is dependent on the amount of content being indexed and the dynamic requirements of this content. Collections can be reindexed independently of each other.

The MySource Matrix search system is still required for items such as backend search.


TRIM Saved Search enhancements [ Feature Request #4180 ]
------------------------------
Searches can now be restricted by TRIM Classification may be specified to restrict search results to an exact classification (eg; Projects) or a classification and its sub-classifications (eg; including Projects - MySource Matrix).

Data Source elements are provided for to expose TRIM Classification elements and each classification portion (eg; Projects, MySource Matrix, Projects - MySource Matrix), for listing and grouping purposes.

TRIM Date values stored in UTC (GMT) format can be converted to the timezone of the Matrix system upon returning the record set. This is provided as an option from the TRIM Saved Search asset.

The Record Type value returned in record sets previously returned a number representing that type. The Record Type is now converted to a textual representation from TRIM, providing text such as "DOCUMENT" instead of the numeric format.


TRIM Record Type filter [ Feature Request #4224 ]
-----------------------
A Record Type Filter is now available in the "General Search Options" of TRIM Saved Search assets to restrict retrieved records to particular TRIM Record Types.

As record types can be custom-built, a list of these are retrieved from the TRIM server when synchronising the Saved Search page, which are then available for selection.

For example, a saved search may be configured to return "Document" types, or both "Document" and "Folder" types.


Date/Time Keyword Modifier [ Feature Request #4181 ]
--------------------------
A new Keyword Modifier, "date_format", is available to format asset attributes which provide a UNIX timestamp. One argument is required to define the PHP date() format used for display.

For example, %asset_created^date_format:Y% will print the four-digit representation of the year in which the current asset was created.

Web Services
Fixed Bug #4204: JS API not handling '#' characters




VERSION 3.26.1

Featured Changes
===================================

JS API: Multiple Set Metadata function [ Feature Request #4128 ]
--------------------------------------
A new function "setMetadataAllFields()" is now available in the JS API. This function takes a single array of field ids and their corresponding values to enable updating multiple fields for an asset in one request.

This provides performance gains over using multiple "setMetadata()" requests. Locks are acquired once and the Metadata Content is generated once for the asset instead of once per field. This function returns TRUE on success and FALSE on failure (eg; when failing to fill in a required field).


Reindex Assets script: Specification of multiple Root Asset Nodes [ Feature Request #4130 ]
-----------------------------------------------------------------
The command line script packages/search/scripts/reindexSearchIndex.php now allows multiple Root Nodes to be entered for reindexing.

The script can now be used as follows:

	$ php packages/search/scripts/reindexSearchIndex.php `pwd`
	Enter the #IDs of the root nodes to reindex (space separated)
	or press ENTER to reindex the whole system: 123 456 789

A prompt will appear to confirm reindexing of each specified node.


Listing Engine: Group by Asset Keyword [ Feature Request #4153 ]
--------------------------------------
A new option is available in Listing Engine assets such as Asset Listing and Search Page, to provide grouping by keywords.

Like existing grouping options, this can be configured from the Asset Grouping screen of these assets. The keyword used for the grouping is supplied without leading or training percentage (%) characters.


TRIM Saved Search: Custom Metadata Fields and Search Logic [ Feature Request #4155 ]
----------------------------------------------------------
TRIM Saved Search assets now allow queries on custom TRIM metadata fields and allow boolean search logic between these terms to be defined.

A set of known metadata fields which is shipped with TRIM are the TRIM Saved Search options by default. This can be expanded by requesting all available fields from the TRIM system, for use in search queries. A "Retrieve Now" button is available from the Details screen to retrieve these fields.

The Search Logic and Result Fields are expanded, and are configured from the Details screen. The layout is similar to that provided for Search Page assets. Fields may be grouped with a boolean operator, and each group is joined by another boolean operator.

For example:

	Group 1:
		- Search field "AnyWord" for value "Fred"
	[ AND ]
		- Search field "Title" for value "Test"

	[ OR ]

	Group 2:
		- Search custom field "Status" for value "Yes"

Groups may be joined only by one common boolean operator, and "NOT" logic is unavailable.

Just like the Search Logic, Result Fields may be composed of standard or custom fields, or both.


Asset Manager lineage listing performance enhancement [ Feature Request #4160 ]
-----------------------------------------------------
A performance enhancement may be evident on systems with large asset trees and/or many links pointing to a particular asset.


Matrix Backup Script: Suppression of minor notices [ Feature Request #4158 ]
--------------------------------------------------
Minor notices such as "file changed as we read it" are now suppressed, to avoid these being sent by email from backup routines scheduled by cron.

VERSION 3.26.0

Featured Changes
===================================

Bundle assets
-------------
Bundle assets allow a group of assets to be taken into Workflow and approved in batches. This asset can be found under the "Schemas" sub-menu in the Asset Map.

"Under Construction" assets without an associated Workflow Schema which are linked under a Bundle, will be set to "Live" when applying for approval. Other assets will follow the next logical Workflow process.

Bundles also have support for Workflow Streams - users have access to any stream they would have access to under at least one bundled asset.


TRIM 6.2 compatibility
----------------------
All functionality provided by the TRIM Package is now compatible with TRIM 6.2. In addition to this, Search and Form posting access can now be provided to non-admin TRIM users who have the appropriate grants. The TRIM Connector supports connections over proxies, determined either from the Matrix Proxy Configuration, or an alternate one specified in the Connector itself.


Matrix System Check script
--------------------------
A test suite to identify system integrity issues on a Matrix System has been added to the "scripts" directory. The script "system_check.php" will run tests which will report on any known inconsistencies in the system. This script will not resolve any issues, so the results must be interpreted and the appropriate action taken.

The script is executed as follows:

	php scripts/system_check.php [ARGS]

	Where [ARGS] can be:
		--system=[MATRIX_ROOT] The path to the matrix system
		--verbose Show more detailed errors
		--colours Use colours
		--stats Show statistics for this process
		--help Show this help screen


Check Indexes System Integrity script: Alter Table for incorrect primary keys
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional checking has been added to this script to verify that primary key constraints are named as expected. For example, "ast_pk" for the sq_ast table. Corrective database queries will be displayed during the script run which must be applied manually.

VERSION 3.26.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================

Workflow Streams
----------------
This functionality allows multiple sets of Workflow Steps per Workflow Schema, and allows Administrators to select which of these sets is to be used for any given Workflow process.

Please note that new and existing Workflow Schema steps will be moved under a "Default Stream" which resides under the related Workflow Schema. This Default Stream cannot be moved or deleted.


Replace Keywords option in Set Value Trigger Action
---------------------------------------------------
A checkbox "Replace keywords in the set value" is provided in the Set Metadata Value and Set Attribute Value Trigger Actions to indicate whether keywords supplied in these fields are to be replaced upon evaluation rather than being treated as literal text. This can be used with both asset-level and Global Keywords.


Public User Trigger Condition
-----------------------------
A Trigger Condition has been added to evaluate whether or not the user who caused the associated Trigger to fire was the Public User (ie; not logged in).


Asset Lineage Design Area: Negative Start Level definition
----------------------------------------------------------
The attribute value for "start_at_level" can now be specified as a negative number to refer to direct parent assets of the current asset.
For example, -1 would refer to the direct parent, -n to the nth direct parent. Other positive numbers (0 = current asset, 1 direct child etc.) still continue to function as previously defined.


Additional Asset Keyword Modifiers
----------------------------------
New Keyword Modifiers have been added, which are:

	- md5 (return the computed MD5 hash of the value)
	- sha1 (return the computed SHA1 hash of the value)
	- stripdecl (strips an XML declaration <?xml ... > from the value)
	- number_format (formats a number with grouped thousands and rounded to x significant digits, defaulting to 0)

Some examples:
	%asset_name^md5% (eg; fred becomes 08b622ddf7eb7c8e44cdb3bd6362f966)
	%asset_attribute_price^number_format:2% (eg; takes 1.235 and shows it as 1.24)


PayPal Payment Gateway modifications
------------------------------------
The PayPal Payment Button asset now supports "Donate", "Add to Cart" and "View Cart" button types, in addition to "Buy Now". The options for each Button Type are available by toggling the Button Type from the "Details" screen and clicking "Commit".

	- Donate Button
	This button allows the name of the Organisation or purpose of the donation to be supplied, as well as the ability to specify a fixed amount.

    - Add To Cart and View Cart buttons
	This allows for cart-based transactions to be maintained by the PayPal environment. The "View Cart" button provides an option to open the cart contents either within the current browser window/tab or in a new window/tab.

	- PayPal IPN Receiver modifications
	This asset has been modified to accept the "Cart" transaction type and to populate the receipt of the generated PayPal Order.


Move Assets Script enhancements
-------------------------------
The Create Links HIPO Job is now used in this script to perform "move" operations, rather than direct asset manipulation.


System Update Lookups Script: Increased Verbosity
-------------------------------------------------
The system_update_lookups.php script now supports an optional "--verbose" argument to display any errors which may occur as a result of updating lookups. The script can now be executed from the Matrix System Root directory as follows:

	php scripts/system_update_lookups.php . 123 --verbose


Globals Site Keywords performance enhancement
---------------------------------------------
Modifications have been made to the Matrix core to provide improvements in the evaluation speed of %globals_site_..% keywords and when site-based options are selected from the Parameter Map.


Get Lineage performance enhancement
-----------------------------------
Instead of loading each asset in the lineage to determine whether they are in Safe Edit, this is now only performed upon assets in the lineage which are in Safe Edit. This should show a slight improvement on the initial load on long lineages with many assets not in Safe Edit.


Purge Trash HIPO performance enhancement
----------------------------------------
A query has been optimised in the Purge Trash HIPO to return assets in "sort order". This modification removes the need to update the sort order of nearby assets, which may result in a performance increase when running this HIPO.
