Remap Manager: Never Delete Enhancements [ Feature Request #4890 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The Remap Manager's Never Delete option allows you to lock specific remaps from being deleted. This new feature improves this existing functionality by adding a variety of enhancements.

A new option has been added to the Remap Manager to purge all remaps in the system except those marked as Never Delete. This option is enabled through a new field on the Details screen of the Remap Manager.

Setting this field to Yes and clicking Commit will purge all remaps in the system that are not marked as Never Delete.

The Web Paths screen of an asset would previously list its remaps but would provide no indication of whether the remap was marked as Never Delete or not. A new column has now been added for remaps on the Web Paths screen to display whether the remap is marked as Never Delete.

Previously, delete fields were available to all remaps listed in the Remap Manager or on the Web Paths screens of assets. These fields were ineffective when used on remaps marked as Never Delete, however they were still accessible. These delete fields will now only be enabled for use on remaps not marked as Never Delete. The delete field will be disabled on remaps marked as Never Delete, as shown in the figure above.

The Remap Manager's Never Delete Added Remaps? field will now be disabled by default, meaning that users must manually enable this option. This field was previously enabled by default; Existing installations using the previous default will retain their settings when being updating.

VERSION 3.28.6

Featured Changes
===================================

REST Resource Assets: Ignore SSL Certificate Verification Option for http_request Attribute [ Feature Request #4511 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new option has been added to the REST Resource and REST Resource Javascript assets to disable SSL certificate verification on HTTP requests.

This option is enabled via a new Disabled SSL certificate verification field on the Details screen of the REST Resource and REST Resource Javascript assets.

Previously, if the SSL verification failed on a request, no data would be returned on the REST asset. This was problematic in cases where the request host used self-signed certificate verification. When enabled, this option allows the REST assets to bypass SSL verification in the request, resolving such issues.


New Parameters to Filter Results on the JS API's getParents and getChildren Functions [ Feature Request #4733 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The Javascript API's getParents and getChildren functions return an asset's parents and children, respectively. Previously, these functions did not allow users to filter these results, instead returning all parents or child assets, by default. This feature adds new type_code, link_type and link_value parameters to these functions, allowing users to filter the returned assets accordingly.

    * type_code: The asset type to return (e.g. page_standard)
    * link_type: The link type to return (SQ_LINK_TYPE_1, 2, 3 or NOTICE)
    * link_value: The link values allowed on the returned assets

The new format of these functions are as follows:

    getChildren(asset_id, levels, type_codes, link_types, link_values, dataCallback)


    getParents(asset_id, levels, type_codes, link_types, link_values, dataCallback)


Specify Attributes to Return on the JS API's getParents, getChildren and getGeneral Functions [ Feature Request #4740 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, the getParents, getChildren and getGeneral functions on the Javascript API did not return non-standard attributes on asset responses. For example, on an Image asset, the varieties, variety_count and title attributes values will not be sent by MySource Matrix. This meant that users would have to make additional API calls to retrieve the appropriate attribute values. This feature adds an new parameter on these functions to specify to return these additional attribute values.

    * get_attributes: whether or not to return the non-standard attribute values of an asset (FALSE by default)

The new format of these functions are as follows:

    getChildren(asset_id, levels, type_codes, link_types, link_values, get_attributes, dataCallback)


    getParents(asset_id, levels, type_codes, link_types, link_values, get_attributes, dataCallback)


    getGeneral(asset_id, get_attributes, dataCallback)


SharePoint Connector Compatible with Sub-Level SharePoint Sites [ Feature Request #4741 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, MySource Matrix's Sharepoint Connector asset would only function correctly when connected at the SharePoint site root and did not support connecting to sub-level SharePoint sites.  For example, the Sharepoint Connector would work correctly with a system at http://sharepointurl/ but not with a system at http://sharepointurl/sub/.

This restriction meant that when using the Sharepoint Connector on the SharePoint Saved Search or Sharepoint List Item Submission Action (Custom Form), only lists created at the root level of the SharePoint site could be accessed and not from sub-level sites.

This feature extends the functionality of the Sharepoint Connector asset to connect with sub-level SharePoint sites


New Keyword Replacement to Display the Asset ID of a Redirect Page [ Feature Request #4752 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new keyword replacement has been added for the Redirect Page to print the Asset ID of the page the user is being redirected to.

    * %redirect_assetid%: The asset ID of the Redirect Page

This keyword replacement could be used, for example, on an applied Paint Layout to display the asset ID to users during a redirect timeout.


Manifest of MD5 Hashes for Matrix System Files [ Feature Request #4757 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A manifest will now be included in the MySource Matrix tarball download, listing the MD5 hashes of each standard Matrix file on the system (except the manifest itself). This manifest can be used as a reference guide, for example, to locate non-standard files in a deployed Matrix installation.

An excerpt of the manifest is shown below:

Automatic Asset ID URL Remaps on Deletion [ Feature Request #4759 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

When an asset is moved to the trash, users have the option of adding URL remapping. These remaps direct the URL of the trashed asset to another asset, for example, a Page not found asset.

Asset ID URLs (e.g. http://example.com/site/?a=100) are frequently used by the WYSIWYG editor's insert link plug-in to link to other assets within the system. As these URLs link to assets directly, however, they were previously not able to locate trashed assets and thus could not be redirected to the appropriate remap.

This feature includes the direct asset ID URL of a trashed asset during URL remapping, as shown above, allowing these asset ID links to function correctly.


Expired Matrix Locks Cron Job [ Feature Request #4761 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new cron job has been added to the Matrix cron manager to clean up expired locks. Expired locks are locks acquired by a user but not manually released. These locks expire after 10 minutes and remain stored in the sq_lock database table.

The Expired Matrix Locks cron job is scheduled to clear these expired locks each time the cron manager is run, improving the stability and performance of your system.


New Keyword Replacement to Print Comment Logs in Workflow Messages [ Feature Request #4765 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new keyword replacement has been added to the Workflow Schema asset to allow comment logs to be printed in custom messages. The %log_message% keyword replacement will print the content, user and date of comments.

This keyword replacement can be used on the following custom workflow messages:

    * Workflow Invitation Message
    * Workflow Approval Message
    * Workflow Rejection Message
    * Workflow Stale Message
    * Workflow Escalated Message


Applying XSL Transformation on an XML Data Source Asset [ Feature Request #4769 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new field has been added to the XML Data Source asset to allow XSL transformation on the content of the data source feed. This allows users to stylise this data source content and preview it in the backend.

In the XSL Transformation field (on the Details screen), select an XSL file for XSL transformation.  You can preview the XSLT output on the Preview screen of the XML Data Source asset.

This feature is an extension of the XML File asset's existing XSL transformation options.

VERSION 3.28.5

Featured Changes
===================================


X-Forwarded-For Header for IP Authentication [ Feature Request #4260 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, MySource Matrix did not support IP Authentication on reverse proxies, such as Squid. As a result of this limitation, the parent server (in this case, MySource Matrix) was not able to identify the IP address of a connecting client - any connection would reveal only the originating address of the proxy server.

This feature adds support for the X-Forward-For HTTP header. This header allows parent servers to discern client IPs when behind reverse proxies. This means that IP restrictions within MySource Matrix can now be used in conjunction with Squid and other reverse proxies.

Setting the Default Never Delete Value For Remaps [ Feature Request #4636 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, remaps created within MySource Matrix were automatically set as Never Delete remaps. This meant that users could not delete the remaps on an asset's URLs or Web Paths screen without first manually changing this setting in the Remap Manager.

This feature allows you to set the default Never Delete value for newly created remaps.

A new field has been added in the Remapping Options section (previously Automatic Remapping) of the Remap Manager to set the default setting for the Never Delete field for each added remap.

If this field is not enabled, remaps will be created as deletable. This erases the multiple steps that would originally have had to be taken to delete remaps that were created as Never Delete.

Ignore Permissions Option in Menu Design Areas [ Feature Request #4707 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new setting has been added to the Menu Normal and Menu Stalks design areas to ignore permissions when displaying assets in the menu of a site. Previously, a user would only see the assets that they had permission to access in a site's menu. With this option enabled, however, users will view all live assets in the menu.

If a user selects an asset that they do not have access to, they will be presented with the system login screen, where they can log in and view the asset.

This option is enabled on the new Ignore Permissions field, configured via a Design Customisation.  By default, this field will be disabled, meaning that permissions will not be ignored.

Metadata Value Support in Export To XML Script [ Feature Request #4716 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The export_to_xml.php script exports details of an asset and all its children to an XML file. Previously, this script did not export any metadata associated with the specified asset or its children. This feature has been added to include the metadata of exported assets when running this script.

An excerpt of an example resulting XML file:

<action>
   <action_id>set_Folder_755_metadata_schema_752</action_id>
   <action_type>set_metadata_schema</action_type>
   <asset>[[output://create_Folder_755.assetid]]</asset>
   <schemaid>[[output://create_Metadata_Schema_752.assetid]]</schemaid>
   <granted>1</granted>
   <cascades>1</cascades>
</action>

<action>
   <action_id>set_Folder_755_metadata_field_754</action_id>
   <action_type>set_metadata_value</action_type>
   <asset>[[output://create_Folder_755.assetid]]</asset>
   <fieldid>[[output://create_Metadata_Field_Text_754.assetid]]</fieldid>
   <value><![CDATA[test_val]]></value>
</action>

In this example, the metadata information of the assets has been included in the XML information. The metadata schema (#752) has been applied to the folder asset (#755) and the value of the metadata field (#754) has been set to test_val.

iCal Data Source Record Set: Date Formatting [ Feature Request #4696 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

New attributes have been added for the iCal Data Source asset to provide alternative date formatting on iCal Data Records. The new attribute values for 'dtend', 'dtstamp', 'dtstart', 'created' and 'last-modified' can be accessed via automatically generated keyword replacements, displayed on the Details screen of the iCal Data Source.

Funnelback sort order dropdown option for External Server Search [ Feature Request #4710 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously if Funnelback search page is configured in Funnelback Server Search mode, it doesn't respect sort order dropdown option. Appending sort order to search page url doesn't make it work. It always searches by relevance as default.

This enhancement makes sure Funnelback search page working in Server Search mode also respects sort order option. So it can search by date, title, url etc.

Add Sort Order to dynamic parameters of Funnelback Search Page [ Feature Request #4717 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, there were only three dynamic parameters available in Funnelback Search page: query, scope, results_per_page

A Sort order parameter has been added, so that if the search page is nested in another page, sort order can be passed from parent as dynamic parameter.

VERSION 3.28.4

Featured Changes
===================================


Allow Assets to be Linked Under Link Assets [ Feature Request #4605 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A small enhancement has been added to MySource Matrix's Link asset to allow other assets to be linked underneath it, as children of the asset.

For example, you could create a set of Link assets that each have an associated Image as a child. This could then be useful when listing these Links on an Asset Listing, dynamically displaying the associated images alongside the links.

This feature improves the usability of the Link asset, enhancing its performance so that it is more consistent with the other assets within MySource Matrix.


setContentOfEditableFileAsset Function for Javascript API [ Feature Request #4623 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The release of MySource Matrix v3.28.3 introduced the createFileAsset function for the Javascript API. This function allowed users to create blank File type assets that users could then manually upload their files to. This feature introduces a new function that extends the Javascript API's functionality of File type assets by allowing you to set the content of editable File assets (CSS, XML, Text, XSL and JS Files).

The setContentOfEditableFileAssets function is enabled through a new Set File Content field on the Details screen of the Javascript API.

This function takes three parameters:

    * assetID: ID of the asset to update content for.
    * content: New content of the asset.
    * dataCallback: the custom callback function (optional).

The format of the setContentOfEditableFileAssets function is shown below:

	function setContentOfEditableFileAssets (assetID, content, dataCallback);

Please note that locks need to be acquired on the asset before setting its content.

This function has been added to provide more flexibility for MySource Matrix's integration with the Easy Edit Suite.


Enhancements to the import_from_xml.php Script [ Feature Request #4639 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Enhancements have been made to the import_from_xml.php script to allow users to set a root node, under which to import their assets.

This script now takes the following two optional arguments:

    * --root-node: the setting of a root node.
    * [ASSET_ID]: the asset ID of the root node to import assets under.

The new structure of the import_from_xml.php script is as follows:

	$ php import_from_xml.php <system_root> <Import File> --root-node [ASSET_ID]

	$ php import_from_xml.php <system_root> import.xml --root-node 125

This function has been added to provide more flexibility for MySource Matrix's integration with the Easy Edit Suite.


Keyword Replacement for Asset URL in Workflow Custom Messages [ Feature Request #4648 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new keyword replacement is now available on Workflow Custom Messages to print the URL of the asset that is in Workflow.

    * %asset_url%: The URL of this asset. 

This keyword replacement can be used on all Workflow messages. An example of its usage is shown below:

	Dear %user_name%,

	Your approval is required on asset "<a href=%asset_url%>%asset_name%</a>".

	<a href=%preview_url%>Preview this Asset</a>
	<a href=%accept_url%>Accept these changes</a>
	<a href=%reject_url%>Reject these changes</a>

When the custom message is sent, a link will appear to the asset.

If an asset has multiple URLs, this keyword replacement will return the closest to the current URL.


New Keyword Modifier to Dynamically Supply Asset IDs on Keywords [ Feature Request #4652 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new keyword modifier has been added that allows you to dynamically supply asset IDs on keyword replacements. This keyword replacement takes the following format:

	%assetid_keyword^as_asset:asset_keyword%

This effectively allows you to print the asset information of any asset (whose ID can be retrieved). For example, you may want to display the delivery address of an e-commerce order. You can use the order number keyword replacement to print this information, as follows:

	%order_number^as_asset:asset_attribute_delivery_addr%

Proxy Support for the Funnelback Search Page [ Feature Request #4654 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, a Funnelback Search Page would return an invalid response when trying to retrieve data from Funnelback using a proxy server:

	Invalid response from the Funnelback server [FNB0002]

This feature adds proxy support to the search page, allowing users on a proxy to connect to the Funnelback server.

Caching 301 Permanent Redirects in the Remap Manager [ Feature Request #4626 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

An enhancement has been added to MySource Matrix's Remap Manager so that cache headers are sent for 301 permanent redirects. This can improve performance in the occasion that the browser does not cache the redirection, preventing the same request from being sent multiple times.

This feature was kindly contributed by MySource Matrix Forum user ndrw.

Best Bets and Contextual Navigation Supported for Funnelback 9.1 [ Feature Request #4662 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The release of Funnelback version 9.1 saw a couple of significant name changes:

    * Fluster to Contextual Navigation
    * Featured Pages to Best Bets

This small enhancement to Matrix updates the tag names for these features to support their functionality in this version.

No Follow Links on Calendar Pages [ Feature Request #4607 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Web crawlers can sometimes cause sites to struggle in MySource Matrix, traversing large numbers of pages associated with event calendars. This performance reduction is mostly due to the next/previous links on week and month views.

This minor enhancement adds a 'nofollow' relation on these links. This will prevent robots from following the next/previous links, eradicating the performance problems on such calendars.

Improved Handling of Typographical Errors in Layouts [ Feature Request #4613 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Sometimes MySource Matrix will find typos in the layout of an asset, for example, (rather than ). Usually, in this case Matrix's asset_edit_interface would return an exception, as it could not find the appropriate metadata screen. In some situations however, the system will be stuck in an infinite loop, constructing the xml of the screen interface and flooding the error log till the system times out.

This minor enhancement improves the handling of such errors, so that these rare error loops do not occur.

Added MIME Type For HTC File in Standard MIME Type List [ Feature Request #4647 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The correct MIME type for HTC files (html component) should be text/x-component. This has been added to Matrix standard MIME type list in order to serve the file correctly before it goes Live.

Redirect Page Errors Display Asset ID [ Feature Request #4519 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, when getting errors from a redirect page that does not have an asset to redirect to, the error given in the logs does not give the asset ID of that Redirect Asset. If you had many pages in your system, it was difficult to find which Redirect Asset the error came from. This enhancement displays the Asset ID of errors in the log files.

VERSION 3.28.3

Featured Changes
===================================


Include Summary option in the Insert Link pop up [ Feature Request #4595 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new option called Include Summary is now available in the Insert Link pop-up in the WYSIWYG Editor.

When you select this option, the keyword replacement %asset_summary_<assetid>% will be added in the link, where <assetid> is the id of the asset that you have linked to.

This keyword replacement will show the summary of the asset in the frontend and will only work when you create a link to file assets, such as Word documents and PDF files.

You can customise the information that is being shown for this keyword replacement in Global Preferences.


Obscuring the SharePoint System from Users [ Feature Request #4504 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The SharePoint package within MySource Matrix allows a user to list the documents of a SharePoint server using the SharePoint Saved Search asset. Previously, the URLs of documents returned from these searches were served from the SharePoint server, meaning that the address of your SharePoint system was visible to users when printing the URLs of documents on the frontend. This feature allows the SharePoint Saved Search to download and serve the returned documents directly from your web server.

This option is configured in a new Download File field on the Details screen of the SharePoint Saved Search. When this field is set to 'Yes', the SharePoint documents will be downloaded to your web server, reflected in the document's download_url on its Details screen.

This is a Features Bazaar feature, chosen for development by attendees of the 2009 MySource Matrix User Conference.


Trigger Action: Remove Workflow Schema [ Feature Request #4582 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new Trigger action has been added to remove a non-running Workflow Schema on an asset.

This Trigger Action will remove the specified Workflow Schema on the asset that fired the trigger. An option to cascade this removal to all children of the asset is also available.

This new action compliments the pre-existing Set Workflow Schema Trigger Action.


createFileAsset Function for Javascript API [ Feature Request #4561 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Currently, the Javascript API does not contain any functions allowing users to create File type assets. The feature introduces the createFileAsset function, creating a blank File type asset (PDF File, Image, MP3 etc.) that users will then be able to upload their files to.

The createFileAsset function is enabled through the Create Asset field on the Details screen of the Javascript API.

This function takes six parameters:

    * parentID: asset ID of parent where the new asset will be linked under.
    * type_code: type code of the new asset (defaults to 'File').
    * friendly_name:  name of the asset being created.
    * link_type: type of link to create for File asset (SQ_LINK_TYPE_1, SQ_LINK_TYPE_2, SQ_LINK_TYPE_3, SQ_LINK_NOTICE).
    * link_value: value of the link to create to parent for this new asset.
    * dataCallback: the custom callback function (optional).

The format of the createFileAsset function is shown below:

function createFileAsset(parentID, type_code, friendly_name, link_type, link_value, dataCallback)

For example, if you want to create a PDF File asset, titled 'my-file', the function can be used as follows:

    createFileAsset(100, pdf_file, my-file);

Once the PDF File asset is created, the user can upload their file to the newly created blank PDF File asset.

This function has been added to provide more flexibility for MySource Matrix's integration with the Easy Edit Suite.


Select Any Asset as a Funnelback Collection Source  [ Feature Request #4540 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Since MySource Matrix's Funnelback package was introduced earlier this year, users have been limited to selecting entire sites when creating collections. This meant that users were not able to index specific sections of their site, often causing unnecessary and lengthy indexing processes.

This feature allows you to now select any asset when creating collections, specifying certain sections of a site to index.

This enhancement will greatly increase the speed and efficiency of Funnelback indexing on your system.

This feature allows metadata keyword replacements to return inherited metadata on alternate contexts.


Keywords on Alternate Contexts Inherit Metadata on the Default Context [ Feature Request #4518 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

By default, on a system with multiple contexts, metadata on alternate contexts which has not been configured will inherit the metadata values of the System's default context. This inheritance, however, was not previously reflected through keyword replacement. Metadata keyword replacements would return no values for metadata fields that had not been manually configured on the alternate context. For example, if you have an alternate context on your system which is inheriting the default context's metadata, keyword replacements such as %asset_metadata_field%, on the alternate context would return a blank value rather than the inherited metadata.

This feature allows metadata keyword replacements to return inherited metadata on alternate contexts.

VERSION 3.28.2

Featured Changes
===================================

Alternate Video File Configurable for Video File Assets [ Feature Request #4506 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new option is available for video file assets to specify a secondary file, allocated as the assets' alternate video source. This file can then be provided as an alternative to users, enhancing the accessibility of the video. For example, if you are using an Ogg video file and you would also like to provide users with the option to download an mp4 version of the video, you can use this attribute to select the mp4 file as the alternate video file for the asset.

The Alternate Video File Asset field is located on the Details screen of the video file. Once set, the alternate video file's attributes can be accessed using the following keyword replacement format:

%asset_attribute_alt_asset_<asset_attribute>%

For example, %asset_attribute_alt_asset_asset_url% will display the URL of the alternate video file.


Disabled SOAP Services Removed from the WSDL File [ Feature Request #4516 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The SOAP WSDL file contains the complex and simple type parameters for the available functions of a SOAP server. Previously, this file would display parameters based on the SOAP API services that were enabled on the SOAP server. For example, if you had enabled the SOAP API asset service on the SOAP server, the parameters of every function within that service would appear in the WSDL file, regardless of whether or not the functions were enabled on the service. This not only cluttered the WSDL with unnecessary parameters but also allowed users to view the parameters required for functions that were not being used.

This feature hides the parameters of those functions that are not enabled on the SOAP server, cleaning up the WSDL file, making it easier to navigate and more relevant to the SOAP server's configuration.


New Keyword Modifiers: Replace and Contains [ Feature Request #4482 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Two new keyword modifiers have been added to MySource Matrix: replace and contains.

The replace modifier replaces a string in the returned value using regular expression. The format of this keyword modifier is shown below.

replace:<string>:<replacestring>

Example: We have an asset named 'MySource Matrix'. Using the keyword replacement %asset_name^replace:Matrix:Mini% will print 'MySource Mini' (replacing 'Matrix' with 'Mini').

The contains modifier will test if a specified string appears in the returned value. The format of this keyword modifier is shown below.

contains:<string>
contains:<string>:<YES>:<NO>

Example: We have an asset named 'MySource Matrix'. We can test the recurrences of the letter M using the keyword replacement %asset_name^contains:M%. This keyword replacement will print '2' as the letter M appears twice in the asset name. Alternatively, you can append the YES and NO parameters to the modifier to check if the string appears in the returned value. The keyword replacement %asset_name^contains:Matrix:YES:NO% will print YES.


Funnelback Search Log Report [ Feature Request #4403 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new log report asset is now available for the Funnelback Search package, providing statistics of searches on a system. This includes details on the most popular search queries and queries which failed to return any results.

The Funnelback Search log report displays the statistics for each collection on a system, as well as a tally of the system-wide total results.

The log report can be configured to display search statistics on either a daily, weekly or monthly basis, with archived reports available on the asset's Report screen.

Word Logic for Funnelback Search [ Feature Request #4410 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Word logic options are now available on the Funnelback Search page to allocate whether searched terms should be excluded or included (any or all) from the search results. These settings can be configured on the backend or on the frontend (via user selection).

The Word Logic field, on the Details screen of the Funnelback Search page, allows you to set the default word logic for the search page.

By default, this is Include any, meaning that results will be displayed if containing at least one of the searched terms. The options Include all (all searched terms must be included in results) and Exclude (search results must not contain the search term) are also available.

The %search_logic% and %metadata_logic_X% keyword replacements can be used to display the word logic options on the frontend of your site. This allows users to define the parameters of their search themselves.


Asset Exclusions from Funnelback Indexing [ Feature Request #4474 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new Asset Exclusions screen is available on the Funnelback Manager to enable to exclusion of assets during Funnelback indexing.

Assets can be specified for exclusion by Asset ID, Type or Root Node. Please note that these exclusions extend across ALL collections. When an exclusion is added, changed or deleted, you will have to run the rebuild cache and reindexing for Funnelback to acknowledge the changes.

File Upload Questions Available For Ecommerce Form Pages [ Feature Request #4497 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature allows you to use File Upload question types on an Ecommerce Form Page enabling users with the ability to upload a file during their form submission.

The File Upload question type works the similarly to the Custom Form's File Upload question type - For more information, refer to the Custom Form manual (http://manuals.matrix.squiz.net/custom-form/chapters/file-upload-question-type).


Enable Make SOAP Call Submission Action in E-Commerce Form [ Feature Request #4498 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A Make SOAP Call submission action has been added to the Ecommerce Form Page, accessed on a new Submission Actions screen (via the Ecommerce Form Contents asset).

This submission action works in a similar manner to the existing Make SOAP Call submission action of a Custom Form (see the Custom Form manual for more information), sending a message to a remote SOAP server on the submission of a form. Question keyword replacements can be used in the SOAP request message to set form answers as parameter values.

The parameter values returned from the SOAP call are then stored as global session variables and can be printed using global keyword replacements.

VERSION 3.28.1

Featured Changes
===================================

Easy Edit Suite Login Design [ Feature Request #4439 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new EES Login Design asset has been added to MySource Matrix to complement the new Easy Edit Suite interface, providing a login page that is visually consistent with the EES's sleek MySource Mini-style design.

When no alternate Login Design has been set for a Site using the Easy Edit Suite, the default MySource Matrix login box will be displayed - styled to resemble the system's Administration interface. The majority of users of the Easy Edit Suite will not be familiar with the Matrix backend, so it is important to provide a smooth user experience by creating a consistent look and feel in all aspects of the EES interface. This is helped achieved using the EES Login Design.

The ees_login_design asset is located in the System Designs Folder, under the System Configuration Folder in the Asset Map. This design can be applied on the Settings screen of the Site you have enabled the Easy Edit Suite for. To do this, select the design in the System Defined Login Design field.

Once the design has been committed, the new Login Design will be used for the Easy Edit Suite's login page on your Site. This login page will be displayed when users who are not logged in attempt to access the /_edit interface.


Separate Permission Role and Workflow Role Systems [ Feature Request #4440 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

When enabling Roles on a system, users previously only had the option of enabling Roles on the entire system, meaning that Roles for both Permissions and Workflow were enabled.

As Roles can be quite performance intensive, this feature allows users to enable Roles individually for both Permissions and Workflow. This means that if, for example, only Workflow Roles were enabled, the system's performance would not be affected when dealing with Permissions.

These fields are located on the system's System Configuration screen.


New "userProxy" objectClass Supported in LDAP [ Feature Request #4449 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, the LDAP package only supported the organizationalPerson and intOrgPerson objectClasses for User objects. This feature introduces the userProxy objectClass, allowing User objects using this objectClass to be expanded in the Asset Map. Such Users would have previously been discarded by the system and excluded from the Asset Map's LDAP tree.


JS API: getChildren() Function Enhancements [ Feature Request #4446 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Enhancements have been made to the JS API's getChildren() function to return NOTICE linked children in the JS API's response. Previously, NOTICE linked children were grouped as Non-Dependant children.

direct_dependant_child => 1
direct_non_dependant_child => 6

This feature enables the JS API to differentiate between these child types, returning values for both Non-Dependant and NOTICE children, as well as for the Dependant children of the asset.

direct_dependant_children => 1
direct_non_dependant_children => 2
direct_notice_linked_children => 4

These enhancements have been added to provide a more comprehensive response from the JS API, assisting in the development of Phase 2 of the Easy Edit Suite.

VERSION 3.28.0

Featured Changes
==================================

ALLOW MULTIPLE "asset_contents_paint_#" KEYWORDS IN TYPE FORMAT BODYCOPY [ Feature Request #4347 ]
-----------------------------
When printing an asset in a Listing Engine, the type format only supports one instance of printing asset contents with an arbitrary bodycopy, using "asset_contents_paint_#".
This feature allows multiple arbitrary paint layout keywords be used in the one type format.


ALLOW ACCESS TO ASSET KEYWORDS FROM ALTERNATE CONTEXTS [ Feature Request #4373 ]
-----------------------------
This new keyword feature allows you to draw a keyword replacement from a context other than the currently used one.
The new feature works like a keyword modifier, using the name of the context as its parameter. For instance, %asset_keyword^context:Context_Name%. If a keyword is not contextable, this modifier will have no effect. 


ALLOW ACCESS TO ASSET KEYWORDS FROM ALTERNATE CONTEXTS [ Feature Request #4316 ]
-----------------------------
Allow you to update the status of a Twitter account from a trigger, based on the content of the triggering asset.
Global keywords and keywords of the triggering asset are supported in the Tweet format.
The Set Twitter Status Trigger Action which were added to this release requires the I18N_UnicodeNormalizer PEAR package, version 1.0.0 to be installed.


JS API FUNCTION TO GET APPLIED WORKFLOW [ Feature Request #4395 ]
-----------------------------
Added a JS API function which could return applied/denied workflow schema on a asset.
Alternately we could pass in an extra argument to see if the applied workflow (if any) is currently running on the asset. 


%asset_url_CONTEXT% KEYWORD [ Feature Request #4348 ]
-----------------------------
When a site has multiple URLs with different base contexts, this keyword will only return the asset URL of a Context if that Context is set as a Base Context of the Site URL. 
e.g. %asset_url_Default_Context% will return the asset URL in default context and %asset_url_French% will return the asset URL for French context.   


%globals_context% KEYWORD [ Feature Request #4350 ]
-----------------------------
A new global keyword %globals_context% which returns the name of the current context.


MAKE METADATA SELECTION FIELD CONSISTENT IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS [ Feature Request #4341 ]
-----------------------------
Assume that you have 2 contexts in your Matrix system, a default context in English and an alternate context in French.
Create a new Metadata Schema with a Selection Field named Title with 2 options in 2 contexts:mr => Mr (English) and Monsieur (French), ms => Ms (English) and Mademoiselle (French) 
This feature will work in a way that if Mr is selected in English, Monsieur would be selected automatically in French.


JS API ABILLITY TO SPECIFY _admin/_edit ACCESS [ Feature Request #4372 ]
-----------------------------
Right now when JS API function call is made it behaves like called in the backend. For example if the status of an asset is changed and if this results in workflow email to be generated, then the links in the email will have _admin links.
This feature allows function call can be made to act as if it was made from Simple Edit Interface. So in the case like above example we could have an _edit link in the emails instead.


HIDE FRAMES IN SIMPLE EDIT MODE [ Feature Request #4347 ]
-----------------------------
In simple edit mode, there is always the top bar frame and side bar asset map frame which is hidden. 
This new option of design asset would allow user to remove this frames completely and only display the main frame. This option is per design.



EXIT DESIGN AREA [ Feature Request #4378 ]
-----------------------------
New design area called "exit". This design area is used when the design needed to stop printing the ignore the rest of the body. Can be used in conjunction with design area if condition.


NEW SOAP AUTHENTICATION FEATURE ALLOW USER TO LOGIN [ Feature Request #4377 ]
-----------------------------
