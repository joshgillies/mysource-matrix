SQUIZ MATRIX CHANGELOG


VERSION 4.16.3

Featured Changes
===================================

New Script to Clean Invalid Remaps [ Feature Request #6515 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new script has been added to help clean up invalid remaps. These may include useless remaps that lead to non-existent pages or infinite redirect loops.

The usage of the system_integrity_invalid_remaps.php script is as follows:

$ php system_integrity_invalid_remaps.php system=<SYSTEM_ROOT>  [--expired_remaps] [--invalid_old_url] [--redirect_chain]  [--invalid_new_url] [--execute]  

This script takes the following optional arguments:

* [--expired_remaps] : Identify remaps that have expired.
* [--invalid_old_url] : Identify remaps that have old, invalid URLs that match to existing assets.
* [--invalid_new_url] : Identify remaps with invalid new, invalid URLs, for example, redirecting to an non-existent asset URL.
* [--redirect_chain] : Identify redirect chains, shortening remaps if execute is specified.
* [--execute] : Clean the invalid remaps found in above reports. 

Specify Service Address on SOAP Assets [ Feature Request #6525 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, SOAP assets within Squiz Matrix (including trigger actions, form actions and data sources) would only use the default SOAP service address and binding, as specified in the WSDL file.

This feature introduces a new drop-down field on these assets, allowing you to specify the service address to send requests to.

Workflow Schema: New Notification Options [ Feature Request #6530 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's Workflow Schema assets provide options to notify the initiator of the workflow process on an asset when the process is completed and the asset changes have been made live.

This feature introduces two new options to the Details screen of the Workflow Schema asset, allowing you to specify to notify both the initiator of the workflow process and the workflow approvers after changes have been approved. 

When the Notify Starter After Approval and Notify Approvers After Approval settings are enabled, the configured Workflow Approval Message custom message will be sent to these users when the changes made to an asset are approved.
By default, the Notify Starter option is disabled, while the Notify Approvers option is enabled, following the existing notification behaviour within Squiz Matrix.

Promotional Code Asset: Condition Variables [ Feature Request #6534 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The E-Commerce package's Promotional Code asset allows you to create rule-based promotional codes for your customers to receive discounts on items within your store.

These discounts are determined by promotional rules, either using a Fixed Amount or Percentage discount type.

This feature introduces new promotional conditions to further configure the promotional codes available within your e-commerce store and specify when a discount should be applied.

These new conditions can be configured in the Promotional Conditions section of the Details screen of the promotional code asset. 

This section allows you to configure a Compare Value condition on the Promotional Code asset, allowing you to compare two values in order to meet the condition, based on a variety of comparison types.

You can use global keywords in the Source and Compare value fields, for example, to compare the metadata of the e-commerce user to a specified value.

So, let's say you created a special 20% discount promotional code, which you want to make available to all Australian users of your store. You can achieve this by creating a promotional condition, using the %globals_user_metadata_address% keyword replacement as the source value and Australia as the comparison, with the comparison type as String - Contains.

This example condition would check the address metadata of customers' user accounts, validating the promotional code if their address contained the string Australia. As a result, users from Australia, who entered this code, would have the 20% discount validated on their order.

This feature has been added to allow you to provide greater flexibility when configuring promotional discounts on your store.

VERSION 4.16.2

Featured Changes
===================================

Calculate Tax on Delivery Fee [ Feature Request #6039 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

New options have been added to the E-Commerce package's Checkout asset's Region Specific Options screen to set the way tax is managed on the delivery fees of e-commerce orders.

* Calculate Tax on Delivery Fee
* Delivery Fee Includes Tax?

If the Calculate Tax on Delivery Fee option is enabled, the configured taxation rate will be calculated on the delivery fee, and added to the order. Alternatively, you can enable the Delivery Fee Includes Tax setting to specify that the delivery fee already includes the specified tax rate; In such cases, the tax will merely be calculated from the full delivery fee and displayed on the order (for example, if the delivery fee is $10.00 and the tax rate is 10%, the delivery fee will be displayed as $9.00 + $1.00 tax).

Custom Form: Word Count Comparison Validation Rule [ Feature Request #6236 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new Complex Validation Rule had been added to questions on the Custom Form Page asset to allow you to specify the validity of a question's response based on its word count.

The following operators can be selected to validate the response:

* Must be this many words in length...
* Must not be this many words in length..	.
* Length must be greater than this many words...
* Length must be less than this many words...
* Length must be at least this many words...
* Length must be no more than this many words...

The Word Count Comparison validation rule is available on both the Text and Email Address question types.

JavaScript API: New Function to Set a Metadata Schema [ Feature Request #6374 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new function has been added to the Javascript API to set or unset a metadata schema on an asset.

The editMetadataSchema function is enabled through a new field on the Details screen of the Javascript API. 

This function takes six parameters:

* assetid: the asset to set or unset the metadata schema on.
* schemed: the metadata schema to set or unset on the asset.
* set: whether the metadata schema is being set (1) or unset (0).
* granted: whether the metadata schema is being applied (TRUE) or denied (FALSE).
* cascades: whether or not the schema should be cascaded to newly created assets.
* dataCallback: the custom callback function (optional).

The format of the editMetadataSchema function is shown below:

editMetadataSchema (assetID, schemaid, set, granted, cascade, dataCallback)

In the example below, we are applying metadata schema #405 on asset #612. We do not want this schema cascaded to newly created assets.

editMetadataSchema (612, 405, 1, 1, 0, function(e){console.log(e);})

When using the Enhanced JS API, the above example would be as follows:

js_api.editMetadataSchema({
assetid: 612,
schemaid: 405,
set: 1,
granted:0,
cascades:0,
dataCallback: function(e){console.log(e);
}}) 


Custom Form: Mandatory Select Response With Initial Empty Value [ Feature Request #6436 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The Custom Form Page's Select question type allows a user to make a selection from a drop-down list of values.

While, previously, this question type allowed you to specify that a response was mandatory, this was not able to be configured whilst also providing users with an initial empty value - a default value had to be designated.

This was an issue when wanting to create a mandatory Select question, but not wanting to have an option already selected as the default.

The feature combats this issue by adding new options on the Details screen of the Select question type, allowing you to specify whether an empty value option can be selected by the user (i.e. whether the question requires a response or not).  

The Allow Empty Option To Be Selected? setting allows you to specify whether the empty value option on the question can be submitted on the form. If this setting is disabled and the user attempts to submit a form using the empty selection, an error will be displayed, as specified in the Empty Option Selection Error field.

Along with these new settings, the Select question type also sees the introduction of a number of validation rules, including: Value Comparison, Numeric Value, Text Found In, Text Contains, Length Comparison, Valid Email, Value Begins With and Value Ends With.

These new validation rules will check against the answer keys of the Select question type.

Image Variety: New Centred Square Constrain Type [ Feature Request #6448 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Image varieties allow you to create alternate versions of Image assets within Squiz Matrix, of varying sizes.

When configuring an image variety, the system will allow you to modify the size of the original image by a variety of different options, including:

* Constrained by a specified height, maintaining the original aspect ratio.
* Constrained by a specified width, maintaining the original aspect ratio.
* Constrained by a maximum dimension (applied to both the height and width) and maintaining the original aspect ratio.
* Resized to a specified height and width.

This feature introduces a new option in the Constrained By field, allowing you to create a square-shaped image variety. 

When selected, the Square (Centre Weighted) option will display a Dimension field, allowing you to specify the size of the square image variety. The image will be cropped (centre weighted) and resized as specified in these settings.

Currently Listed Asset Keywords in Nested Content Listings [ Feature Request #6449 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This new feature extends the use of the %list_current_*% keyword replacement (e.g. %list_current_asset_name%) to refer to the current asset being listed by a listing or search page in the Additional GET Variables settings of nested content.

This feature has been added to allow more flexibility in the keyword replacements that can be passed through as variables in nested content areas.

Password Reset Page: New Check Browser Session Option [ Feature Request #6456 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, the Password Reset Page was not able to properly handle the resetting of passwords for two users in the system with the same email address, due to the password reset link being sent to their email address.

This feature adds a new option to the Password Reset Page to force users to open the emailed reset link in the same browser session in which the password reset was requested. This helps to rectify the previous issue, ensuring that no other users on the same email address will be able to complete the password reset request on another user's account.

Disable the Root User Account [ Feature Request #6466 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's root user account has the highest level of access within the system, with the ability to view and modify all fields and screens. System administrator users have a similar level of permission, although they do not have access to all options available within the system configuration and system management settings.

This feature introduces a new option on the system's main.inc file, allowing you to disable the root user account and give root access to system administrators.

SQ_CONF_ROOT_USER_DISABLED 

By default, this new option is set to 0. When this value is set to 1, the root user account on the system will be disabled. This means that, while the actual root user asset will remain in the system, the account will lose its functionality and will not be able to be logged into.

All root privileges, including access to the system configuration and system management settings, will be given to system administrator users.

Once disabled, the root user account can be easily reinstated by changing this new main.inc setting back to 0.
This feature has been added in order to allow system administrators full access to their Squiz Matrix installation.  

New Spam Prevention Options on the Custom Form and Asset Builder [ Feature Request #6481 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Also this week, we have three new spam prevention options available on the Custom Form and Asset Builder assets.

* Google reCAPTCHA: allows you to implement Google's free reCAPTCHA anti-bot service, which also servers to digitize books, newspapers and old time radio shows.

* Honeypot Question: enables the creation of a honeypot or dummy question. This is used to identify spam bots who fill in the field, that would otherwise be left blank by regular users.

* Submission Time Threshold: uses the time taken between the form load and form submission to help identify possible spam bots, based on a set minimum time.

Each of these new spam prevention options are available for configuration on either the Form Contents screen of Custom Form assets, or the Details screen of Asset Builder assets.

These new options have been added to compliment the existing spam prevention options available for forms on Squiz Matrix, by providing more accessible anti-spam alternatives.

VERSION 4.16.1

Featured Changes
===================================

Save as XML Completion Action on E-Commerce Checkout Page [ Feature Request #6413 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The Custom Form Page's Save as XML submission action is used to export form submissions as an XML structure.

This functionality has been extended to the E-Commerce package's Checkout Page asset via a new Save XML completion action that will export the details of an e-commerce order to an XML file after the checkout process has successfully been completed.

The Save as XML action can be configured on the Checkout Completion Actions screen of a Checkout Page asset.

Like the form submission action, the Save as XML action allows you to configure the location to save the resulting XML files to. You are also able to specify whether to include the transaction and merchant reference numbers on the XML file.

Search/Listing Assets: Use Individual Entries of Multi-Option Metadata as Group Sources [ Feature Request #6426 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature introduces a new Group by Individual Entry option to the Grouping Screen of search and listing assets, allowing individual entries of multi-option metadata fields to be used as grouping sources.

This new field supports Multi Text, Selection, Thesaurus and Hierarchy metadata fields.

OAuth 2.0 Integration Within Squiz Matrix [ Feature Request #6430 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature introduces the new OAuth2 package for Squiz Matrix, providing third-party integration with OAuth 2.0 providers, such as Facebook, Google and LinkedIn.

The package includes two new assets, the OAuth Account Manager and the OAuth2 Token that can be used together, as well as in conjunction with other assets for a variety of authentication option.

The OAuth2 Token asset allows you to configure authentication with an OAuth 2.0 provider. Once authenticated, the token has a variety of storage and refresh options. This asset can be used with the REST Resource assets (including the REST Resource form and trigger actions) to make OAuth protected REST API calls.

Additionally, the OAuth2 Token asset can be used together with the new OAuth Account Manager asset to support single sign-on and identity verification with an OAuth 2.0 account, for example, your Facebook account.

When configured with an OAuth2 Token, the Account Manager asset will allow you to link authenticated third-party accounts with existing Squiz Matrix accounts. If no associated user account is found, the OAuth Account Manager will automatically create a new account within Matrix to link with.

VERSION 4.16.0

Featured Changes
===================================

New Trigger Condition: Current User is an LDAP User [ Feature Request #6202 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new trigger condition has been added to Squiz Matrix to evaluate whether the user who fired the trigger is an LDAP user or not.

When this condition is added, you can specify whether the condition is met if the user IS or IS NOT an LDAP user. This condition will match against any LDAP user types, including Simple Edit LDAP users, Backend LDAP users and regular LDAP users.

NOTICE Links for News Item Summary and Body [ Feature Request #6235 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

NOTICE links within Squiz Matrix are created to indicate that something will be affected if the linked asset is deleted, for example, if an asset is the Index or Home Page of your site, or if an asset has been linked within the bodycopy content of another asset. 

Previously, however, NOTICE links were not supported for linked assets within the Summary and Body content fields of News Item assets. This could cause potential issues with Safe Trash, which would look for any NOTICE links before deleting trashed items; no warning would be given.

This feature extends the usage of NOTICE links to also include links within News Items Summary and Body.

Multiple Payment Gateways on E-Commerce Checkout and Form Page Set Ups [ Feature Request #6375 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously within Squiz Matrix, the E-Commerce package (both the Delivery Method and Ecommerce Form Page assets) did not support multiple Payment Gateways. This meant that users could not be given the option to choose the specific payment method to complete the e-commerce process.

This feature introduces the ability to set multiple payment gateways on a single e-commerce set up within Squiz Matrix.

New PayPal Express Checkout Payment Gateway [ Feature Request #6376 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature introduces a new payment method to Squiz Matrix's E-Commerce Package: The PayPal Express Checkout Payment Gateway.

VERSION 4.16.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================

New Script to Morph Asset Types [ Feature Request #6262 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new script has been added to Squiz Matrix to morph an asset from from one asset type to another. This is useful when dealing with file and user asset types, for example, morphing a User asset into a Backend User asset.

The morph_assets.php script is found in the system's Scripts directory and takes the following parameters:

* the root directory of your Squiz Matrix system.
* the root ID to morph the child assets of.

Custom Form: Allow Public Users to Save Form Submissions [ Feature Request #6306 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's Custom Form allows logged-in users to Save and Exit their form submission, retaining the content of their incomplete submission, which they can return to finish at a later time.

Previously, however, this functionality was not available for public users. This feature extends the Save and Exit function to also include public users, allowing them to save the content of a form submission to complete later.

When a public user saves their submission and exits the form, they will be sent an email, containing a link to return to the form and a password, allowing them to access and complete their submission.

This feature can be enabled and configured via the new Public User Incomplete Submission section on the Form Contents screen of the Custom Form's Form Contents asset.

The settings available allow you to configure the format of the Submission Retrieval Email for a public user, as well as the Submission Retrieval Message (displayed when the user Saves their form content) and Password Verification Form (when returning to a previously saved form).

VERSION 4.12.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================

New Custom Change Password Design [ Feature Request #5788 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

When a user account is placed up for review within Squiz Matrix, users will be prompted to change their current Squiz Matrix password on a Change Password screen.

Previously, the design of this screen was not configurable. This feature adds new functionality, allowing you to set a custom Change Password design.

The System Defined Password Change Design options can be found on the Settings screen of an asset. These tools work in a similar manner to the System Defined Login Design, enabling you to override the default design of the Change Password screen for the asset, automatically cascaded to any children. 

When users log on to the system and require a password change, the Change Password screen will use the custom design, specified in the System Defined Password Change Design settings.

This feature has been added to complement the other custom log-in designs within Squiz Matrix.

New Trigger Action to Schedule a Bulkmail Job [ Feature Request #5853 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Along with the aforementioned Bulkmail Job Scheduling feature, a new trigger action has also been added to Squiz Matrix to schedule a Job to be run when a trigger is fired.

The Schedule Bulkmail Job trigger action can be configured to override the default settings of a selected Bulkmail Job, allowing you to instead send the asset that fired the trigger (or an asset of your selection), as well as selecting the recipients of the job.  

You are also able to enable the Subscription Filter on the selected Bulkmail Job, specifying whether to use the Bulkmail Job's set subscription filters or to override these filters. This is a new feature to the Bulkmail Package which is outlined in more detail below.

This feature has been added to provide users with additional implementation options for their Bulkmail set ups. 

Bulkmail Job: New Scheduling Settings Screen [ Feature Request #5854 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's Bulkmail Job asset defines the content and recipients of a bulkmail configuration. Previously, for a Bulkmail Job to be run, users would have to manually change the asset's status or use the schedule_bulkmail_job.php script.

This feature adds new settings to the Bulkmail Job asset, allowing you to enable and configure automatic scheduling of your jobs.

The Bulkmail Job Scheduling screen allows you to enable scheduling for the job and provide a start date. You can then specify the frequency of how often the job should be run (either hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly or not at all).  

Once enabled, the Bulkmail Job will be queued to run at the specified start date and time, and then continue to run subsequently at the specified frequency.

This feature has been added to provide users with effortless scheduling of the jobs within their bulkmail configurations.

Bulkmail Job: New User Subscription Screen [ Feature Request #5856 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

We have one more new screen that has now been added to the Bulkmail Job asset, this time allowing you to configure user subscriptions for the jobs within your bulkmail configuration.

The new User Subscriptions screen allows you to enable user subscriptions for your Bulkmail Job. When subscriptions are enabled, categories can be created, comprised of Asset Metadata Field rules to match a user asset's metadata against a specified value. 

User Subscriptions utilise the use of a Search Page asset to query a selection of assets using the matched subscription metadata value. Assets returned on these searches will then be sent (individually) to the users within the corresponding subscription category.

For example, you could create a location subscription category, matching metadata values such as Sydney and Melbourne. The Search Page would search these queries, and return a selection of articles for these users, sending them content appropriate to their location.

Call REST Resource Completion Action on E-Commerce Checkout Page [ Feature Request #5865 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The Custom Form Page's Call REST Resource submission action is used to communicate with a web service exposing itself using Representational State Transfer (REST) methods, upon submission of a form.

This functionality has been extended to the E-Commerce package's Checkout Page asset via a new Call REST Resource completion action that will call a REST resource server after the checkout process has successfully been completed on an e-commerce order.  

The Call REST Resource action can be configured on a new Checkout Completion Actions screen of a Checkout Page asset. This screen is similar to the Submission Actions screen of a Custom Form.

Like the form submission action, the Call REST Resource allows you to configure the HTTP request to the REST web server, passing details of the e-commerce order within the request body content (incl. the order summary, the delivery form responses and the individual item details).

The completion action also allows you to set custom parameters for Product asset types on a new Order Array keyword, as well as configure the Error Response Notification Email for non-2xx responses from the REST server.

REST Resource JavaScript: V8 JS Engine [ Feature Request #5869 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Current the REST Resource JavaScript asset only allows you to use the SpiderMonkey JS engine to execute JS commands. This feature introduces the option of using the V8 engine, if the PECL V8js extension installed.

Additional SAML Options for User Linking and Creation [ Feature Request #5873 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

In this month's releases of Matrix, we unveiled federated access management single sign-on and identity verification through our new SAML Account Manager asset. This feature adds further options to this asset, allowing you to set the linking settings for users (automated in current release), as well as allow Matrix to automatically create linked local users during the authentication process.

The Allow Linking to Existing Users and Automatic Creation options are available on the Details screen of the SAML Account Manager. 

By default, linking to existing users is enabled. This means that is a user is logged in to Squiz Matrix and their account is SAML authenticated, the SAML Account Manager will prompt the user to link their accounts, if they have not yet been. This linking allows for federated access to the system, automatically signing the user into their account as part of the SAML authentication process.

The Automatic Creation option handles the creation of linked local users when a user is not logged into Matrix. By default, this is a manual process, with users being allowed to create a new user account during SAML authentication. Enabling this option will automate this creation, skipping this manual process.

This feature has been added to provide users with more options for configuring SAML federated access management on their systems.

OAuth Session: Redirect to Authorise, Store Access Token [ Feature Request #5874 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's REST Resource OAuth assets allow you to define the parameters for OAuth authentication when communicating with an OAuth secure REST web service. This feature introduces additional parameters, allowing you to redirect users to an external authorisation page and providing the option of permanently store the access token.

The Redirect to Authorise and Store Access Token options are available on the Details screen of REST Resource OAuth assets. 

By default, neither of these options will be enabled.

Enabling the Redirect to Authorise option will redirect a user to the service provider's authorisation page to authorise the request token instead of simply nesting the authorisation form within Squiz Matrix.

The Store Access Token option allows you to permanently store the access token. By default, this token is stored in the session, meaning that when a user logs out, the token will be lost. Permanently storing this token will prevent users from having to reauthorise in each user session. Disabling this option will remove any permanently stored tokens.

These features have been added to bring Squiz Matrix OAuth more in line with established authentication standards. 

New Keyword to Print the ID of a Paint Layout on an Asset [ Feature Request #5878 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new keyword replacement has been added to Squiz Matrix to print the asset ID of the paint layout on an asset.

%asset_paint_layout_id% 

This keyword will print the asset ID of the Paint layout applicable for the asset on the current URL, whether asset-based, URL-based or user-defined.

This keyword can be used in conjunction with the as_asset keyword modifier which dynamically supplies an asset ID (in this case, of a Paint Layout) on a set asset_keyword. This will allow users to expose the properties and attributes of a Paint Layout within an asset's content.

%asset_paint_layout_id^as_asset:asset_name% 

The above keyword format, for example, would print the name of the asset's Paint Layout.

New Context Functions on JavaScript API [ Feature Request #5891 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Five new functions have been added to the JavaScript API for retrieving and setting context information.

	- getAlternateContext() : retrieves the alternate context applicable to current situation where Squiz Matrix will go through each context and evaluate based on the conditions defined in them.
	- getCurrentContext() : retrieves the current context active on the system.
	- getAllContexts() : retrieves all contexts defined in the system.
	- setContext() : sets a context via the API.
	- restoreContext() : restores the context to what it was previously set to. Should be used in conjunction with setContext().

Performance Mode Enhancements [ Feature Request #5910 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The following enhancements have been made to Squiz Matrix's Performance Mode:

	- Performance mode will now display the time spent on queries, together with the number of queries.
	- Fixed issue where some queries (those called with getXX() style functions) were being repeatedly counted.

VERSION 4.8.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================


Cache Manager: Additional Send Cacheable Header Settings [ Feature Request #5409 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, Squiz Matrix did not send cacheable headers for SSL encrypted requests.

This feature addresses this issue by adding new settings to the Cache Manager's Send Cacheable Header screen, allowing you to specify the protocol when cacheable headers will be sent (HTTP, HTTPS or both). Additional options allow you to configure the cache-control level for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

Asset Logs Screen: Internal Messages Performance Enhancement[ Feature Request #5414 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, loading on the Asset Logs screen could be potentially slow on systems containing large numbers of internal messages. This feature refines the process of retrieving the list of valid asset types and the saving of internal messages, to improve the performance of the Asset Logs screen.

Online Quiz Interactive Mode [ Feature Request #5456 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new Interactive Mode has been added to the Online Quiz asset. This mode transforms the regular listed quiz format into a one question per page format, with the option of allowing users to retry incorrectly answered questions.

Interactive Mode is enabled via a new field on the Details screen of the Online Quiz asset.

Enabling Interactive Mode will display the Question Pooling settings. These settings allow you to select the root node(s) to extract the multiple-choice questions from, as well as set the number of retries available to users for each question.

Interactive Mode utilises a new feedback page on completion of each question. Response feedback can be specified for each response on the Details screen of an Online Quiz Multiple-Choice Question.

When a user answers a question on the form, the Online Quiz will display whether or not the user selected the correct answer and present any feedback that has been configured. If the user has given an incorrect answer, they will able to retry the question, with another selected from the question pool and presented to them.

Listing item classes are allocated for each option on the feedback form, as well as span tags for the response feedback. These can be used to stylise (CSS etc.) the feedback information and listed options, for example, a tick or cross for the option the user has selected.

New keyword replacements have been added to format the layout of the Online Quiz in Interactive Mode:

	- %interactive_question_number%
	- %interactive_question_note%
	- %interactive_question_text%
	- %interactive_question_response_form%
	- %interactive_button% 

In addition to these changes, a new scoring system has been implemented for the Online Quiz. Scores will now be stored in the submission assets of the Online Quiz.

You are also able to specify the format of the %quiz_score% keyword replacement, used in the submission logs, and the Thank You and Page Contents bodycopies. This format is configured on a new Score Format field on the Details screen of the Online Quiz asset. 

User IP Forwarding on http_request Attributes [ Feature Request #5479 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature introduces the additional option of User IP forwarding on the HTTP request of REST Resource assets (incl. the Call REST Resource Trigger and Form Submission actions).

An additional "Append Query String to the Request URL" option is also available, allowing you to append the query variables passed to the Squiz Matrix URL on the HTTP request.

Brand New: Decision Tree Asset [ Feature Request #5494 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new Decision Tree asset has been developed for Squiz Matrix, leading users through a dynamic series of questions and displaying a final result based on the responses given. By engaging your users through an interactive decision process, the Decision Tree asset allows you to provide information and content that caters specifically on an individual user basis.

The Decision Tree asset is essentially comprised of:

	- Questions: the questions your users will answer on the decision tree. Questions can be formatted as either select or numeric question types and are similar in configuration to existing questions in form assets.
	- Results: result bodycopies are created to display to users based on their answers. 
	- Answer Destinations: response-based destinations for questions on your Decision Tree. An answer destination can be either another question or a result bodycopy. This allows you to cater the questions and results displayed specifically based on the responses your users give.

Decision Tree assets can also implement a points-based system where point values are accumulated based on the responses given. Response bodycopies can then be allocated a points range and are dynamically displayed based on the accumulation of points once users reach a question that does not have an allocated answer destination (ie. the end of the Decision Tree).

A number of new keyword replacements are available when formatting the content of the Decision Tree asset. These include:

Page Contents Bodycopy:

	- %decision_tree_contents%
	- %reset_button%

Decision Tree Question Bodycopy:

	- %question_title%
	- %question_field%
	- %question_note%
	- %accumulated_points%
	- %question_button% (numeric only)

Result Bodycopy:
	
	- %accumulated_points%

Additionally, question and result bodycopies on the Decision Tree are wrapped with division tags and classes for easy design implementation and CSS styling.

The introduction of this new Decision Tree asset aims to provide Matrix users with an alternative to complex graphs and diagrams which can be confusing to site users. The interactive decision process allows you to present information tailored specific to users in a simple and accessible manner.

2-Legged OAuth Authentication Available on REST Resource Assets [ Feature Request #5497 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature introduces 2-legged OAuth authentication on the REST Resource assets, in addition to the existing 3-legged OAuth.

2-legged OAuth, allows users to simplify the authentication procedure by eliminating the user authorisation process of 3-legged OAuth, establishing a direct client-server scenario.

This new authentication method is available through a new "REST Resource OAuth 2 Legged" asset. The OAuth parameters available on this asset include the Consumer Key, Secret and Signature Method (HMAC-SHA1 or PLAINTEXT).

Update Link Trigger Action [ Feature Request #5511 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Trigger actions allow you to specify tasks that will be performed when a fired trigger meets a specified set of conditions. Squiz Matrix boasts an extensive array of trigger actions that are available, from creating new assets to updating your status on twitter.

This feature introduces a brand new trigger action to update the type and value of a specified link. 

The Update Link trigger action allows you to update a single link. This link can be specified by link ID or, alternatively, you can identify attributes to match a link on the firing asset, including the link type and value, the side of the link to look on (parent or child) and the asset type of the linked asset.

This trigger action has been added to strengthen the functionality of the Squiz Matrix trigger system and expand on the trigger set-ups available to users.

Recurring Calendar Event Frequency Threshold Global Preference [ Feature Request #5515 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new Global Preference has been added to limit the frequency that Recurring Calendar Events appear on Upcoming Events List and Event Search Page assets.

This is configured by an Event Frequency Threshold option, that allows you to set a minimum threshold (in days) for Recurring Calendar Events. If the frequency of the Calendar Event falls within this threshold, the event will only appear once on the listing.

WYSIWYG Insert Link Tool: Direct Links to Asset External Target URLs [ Feature Request #5517 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The WYSIWYG's Insert Link tool allows you to insert a hyperlink to an external site or an internal asset. Previously, however, this tool, when creating links to Link and Redirect Page assets, would create a link directly to that asset (e.g. "./?a=123").

This features introduces new functionality that allows you to link directly to the target URLs of Link and Redirect Page assets.

A new Asset Type field has been added to the Insert Link tool. This field allows you to specify whether the link is to a Link or Redirect Page asset or, if not, any other asset.

When a user selects ether the Link Asset or Redirect Page Asset options, only assets of those types will be able to be selected in the Select Asset field. Once an asset is selected, and a global keyword replacement will be automatically printed in the Link field, linking directly to the target URL of the asset, as follows: 

	- %globals_asset_attribute_link_url:123%
	- %globals_asset_attribute_redirect_url:123%  

This feature has been added to aid editors and simply the process of linking to external urls on Matrix assets.

Load Balancing "Read" Database Connection Support [ Feature Request #5541 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature introduces load balancing when distributing connections to multiple database servers, enabling support of multiple 'read' databases.

Databases are configured in the system's db.inc file and can be specified weight and timeout values to des gnat when/how the system will make a connection to these servers. The use of multiple 'read' databases is expected to significantly improve performance on complex systems that experience issues with a single connection setup.

Please note that modification of the db.inc file should only be performed by a system administrator.

VERSION 4.6.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================


Remove Trailing Slash Off Requested URLs and Redirect [ Feature Request #5138 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Within Matrix, a URL with or without a trailing slash will render the same content. As the Cache Manager treats every URL uniquely, however, Matrix would previously end up caching both of these URLs, resulting in two separate cache entries for the same content.

This feature strips the trailing slash off such front-end requested URLs and redirect them, resulting in just one cache entry for the URL content.

Please note that this feature does not apply to root URLs due to the possibility of apache being configured to append the trailing slash. 

Global Preference to Restrict Assets Created Under Specified Sites as Type 2 Linked [ Feature Request #5161 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The new 'Child Creation Type 2 Link Restriction' global preference allows users to specify site assets to restrict newly created children to TYPE 2 links only. This means that any newly created assets under these sites (at any depth) will only be able to be created as TYPE 2 linked assets.

The link type of these assets can still be changed after asset creation via the asset's Linking screen.


New Script to Evaluate and Fix Files in the Public Data Directory [ Feature Request #5171 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Matrix's public data directory houses File assets on the Matrix system that are publicly accessible (live with public read access). However, in some cases this directory may be missing files or contain old or private files due to file system permission problems and other issues.

This feature introduces the system_integrity_fix_public_files.php script. When run, this script will update any out-of-date files on the public data directory, create any files that are missing from the directory and remove any files that are private and should not be in the directory.

Usage of this script is as follows:

$ php system_integrity_fix_public_files.php SYSTEM_ROOT ROOT_ID 

System Integrity Clean Invalid Links Script [ Feature Request #5175 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's system_integrity_orphaned_assets.php script finds and links orphaned assets underneath a specified asset ID. It also takes care of invalid links, where the major ID in a link is a missing asset; it does not, however, cater for when the child minor ID is missing while the major ID still exists.

This feature introduces the system_integrity_invalid_links.php script. This script will remove significant links where one or both sides of a link does not exist. This script will also report on the number of orphaned assets in the system and may recommend running the system_integrity_orphaned_assets.php script, upon its completion.

New Keyword Modifier to Apply XSLT to XML Content [ Feature Request #5183 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Keyword modifiers allow you to modify keyword replacements to further configure their returned values. This feature adds a new keyword modifier to apply XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) to XML content returned on the keyword.

The format for this keyword modifier is as follows.

%keyword^xslt:<assetid>%
 
%asset_contents_raw^xslt:343% 

This modifier will take the XSLT of a file asset (specified by asset ID), apply it to XML returned on the asset and output the result.

This feature has been added to allow users to transform the XML of assets, providing greater control over the content of their sites.

New System Forking Scripts [ Feature Request #5294 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature adds three forking scripts, aimed to increase the performance of these scripts and prevent memory leakage, especially on larger systems where memory usage is otherwise too high and/or performance of single-threaded scripts is too slow.

The scripts added are:

system_apply_permissions.php : takes a permission string in a specific format that allows you to run multiple permission operations on the specified asset and their children. This script forks and runs in batches to curb memory usage and also runs multiple threads in parallel to speed up the overall operation.

system_apply_metadata_schema.php : applies a metadata schema to the specified assets and their children (and generates the metadata for that asset). Runs in batches and multiple threads in parallel.

system_update_lookups.php : updates lookups for all assets under the specified root node. Forks and runs in batches to keep memory usage down.


%asset_contents_paint_X% on Paint Layout Bodycopy [ Feature Request #5323 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The %asset_contents_paint_X% keyword replacement is used on an Asset Listing Page to print the content of an asset with a specified Paint Layout applied. For example, the keyword %asset_contents_paint_1234% would apply the layout of asset #1234 to the asset content.

This feature enables the use of this keyword replacement for use within a Paint Layout bodycopy. This can be useful, for example, when using Conditional Keywords, to print the asset content with other Paint Layouts applied, based on the conditions specified.

This feature has been added to aid in the implementation of Paint Layouts, providing users with more flexibility and control over their content.

VERSION 4.4.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================


Logout Due to IP Change Logged in System Logs [ Feature Request #4604 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, when a user was logged out of Squiz Matrix because their IP changed and SQ_CONF_ALLOW_IP_CHANGE was set to true, neither an error or a system.security.* message would be sent. This meant that the only way to figure out why users were intermittently losing their session was to have prior knowledge of this setting.

This feature had been added so that Matrix will log logouts due to IP changing in the system logs. For example:

[2011-05-23 15:11:23][12:Root User][1024:mysource notice][ ] [system.security.logout.ip_change - remote_addr:192.168.1.1;sessionid:;] (User Automatically Logged Out) - User "Root User" was logged out since their IP address changed from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.1.1.

Enhancements to the import_files_from_bridge.php Script [ Feature Request #5033 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's import_files_from_bridge.php script imports files exposed through a File Bridge asset into Matrix. Previously, this script would import these files as File type assets; however, files will now be imported as corresponding Matrix file assets, when available. For example, an image will now be imported as an Image type asset. 

This feature also introduces the option of importing folders containing an index.html file as a Standard Page asset with the content of the index file. This option can be enabled by setting a parameter on the script.

The new usage of the import_files_from_bridge.php script is as follows:

php import_files_from_bridge.php <MATRIX_ROOT> <BRIDGE_ROOT_NODE_ASSETID> <PARENT_ASSETID> <RECURSIVE> <HANDLE_INDEX_FILE>
 
php import_files_from_bridge.php path/to/matrix 100 150 y y

Make SOAP Call Step Action For Multi-Page Forms [ Feature Request #5089 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Currently, Squiz Matrix's Custom Form asset allows you to make a SOAP call on submission. This new feature extends the functionality of submission actions to the individual steps (or pages) of a multi-page Custom Form, allowing your form to make a SOAP call on each page submission.

Step actions can be configured on the new Step Actions screen for form sections.

The set up of the Make SOAP Call step action is similar to the Make SOAP Call submission action, allowing you to specify the connection to the SOAP server and specify the request message.

On the front end of the form, when a user clicks the Next Page button, Squiz Matrix will make the SOAP call, as configured on the Step Actions screen for that step.

The Make SOAP Call step action also utilises the new Check Response function. This function will check specified fields on the SOAP response, printing an error message if a value is returned (non-empty). Field keywords are also available for use, allowing you to print any error messages returned on the SOAP response.

Returned errors are displayed to a user via the %form_errors% keyword replacement and the user will not progress to the next page of the form. If no errors are retrieved, the user will be able to continue their form submission. 

SharePoint CMIS Bridge [ Feature Request #5090 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This new feature introduces the CMIS Bridge asset, a connection bridge for retrieving files from a CMIS enabled SharePoint repository (currently supports Microsoft SharePoint 2010).

This asset retrieves SharePoint documents in a similar manner to the SharePoint Saved Search; however, files imported over the CMIS Bridge will be imported as fully functional system assets within Squiz Matrix (such as Images, Text Files etc.). These assets can be edited, linked and moved around the system just like any other asset, allowing you greater control over your SharePoint repositories within Matrix. 

Files are stored under the CMIS Bridge asset in the asset map when initially synchronised with the connected CMIS enabled SharePoint repository. Further synchronisation will update these files, trashing any old files, modifying files that have been altered and creating new assets for new files on the repository.

Synchronisation is also controlled via a new Sync CMIS Bridges Cron Job. This cron job is set to run daily - its run time and frequency can be configured on its Details screen.

CMIS properties (e.g. Author, Objectid, Modified, Created) can be mapped to the metadata fields of a schema applied to the CMIS Bridge. Additional custom fields created for the document library will dynamically be made available for metadata mapping.

The addition of this asset enhances the SharePoint package within Squiz Matrix, allowing you to manage your SharePoint documents within Matrix with more control than ever before.

Search Page: Specify Data Sources on Exclude Fields [ Feature Request #5094 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, Matrix's Search Page only allowed you to configure data sources for search fields. The data sources allowed you to specify which fields on an asset to search. This feature extends this functionality to exclude fields, allowing you to specify which fields to exclude on.

Like a search field, exclude fields allow the following data source types:

Include All: searches all standard fields, attribute fields and metadata fields of assets.
Standard Asset Field: searches a specified standard asset field (e.g. the name of a page or its asset ID).
Asset Attribute: searches a specified attribute field (e.g. the title of a file of a MS Word Document asset).
Asset Metadata Field: searches a specified metadata field.

You can select multiple data sources to search for each exclude field that you add, specifying the word logic to use for your data sources (all words or any word).

Please note that existing exclude fields will default to the Include All data source type, returning the same results as they would previously had.

On the Search Page, the exclude field will only search the fields specified in its data sources. For example, say you configure the exclude field to search the Keywords metadata field of assets - if a user searches for the query News in the exclude field, the Search Page will exclude assets contain the query News in their Keywords metadata from the search results.

This enhancement to the Search Page's exclude fields allows you to tweak your Search Page, allowing your users to return more accurate results, specific to their searching queries.

Specifiying the Cron Deadlock Email Notification Receivers [ Feature Request #5103 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's Cron Manager handles the cron process within a system, managing and running the cron jobs that have been scheduled. Occasionally, a cron job may stall, causing the Cron Manager to deadlock. When this occurs, Matrix will send out email notifications, informing users of these errors.

Previously, Matrix would send these deadlock email notifications to all users under the System Administrators Folder, as well as the email addresses configured in the system's main.inc file. These automated email notifications would be resent to these users each subsequent run of the Cron Manager, until the issue was resolved. This could cause large numbers of emails sent to many users, potentially causing inconvenience and even spam filtering issues with users' mail clients.

This feature adds a new option to the Cron Manager, allowing you to specify the users that will receive cron deadlock emails. This option is configured via a new Emailing Options section on the Options screen of the Cron Manager.

The Cron Deadlock Email Receivers field allows you to select users, user groups and roles to specify which users should receive email notifications from the Cron Manager. By default, the system's Root User and the email addresses configured in the system's main.inc file will automatically also receive these emails.

By allowing you to specify the users to receive cron deadlock emails, this feature allows you to more efficiently identify and manage any potential issues with the Cron Manager in your system.

A-Z Listing: Defining the Layout of Individual Letters on the Navigation List [ Feature Request #5124 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

On a multiple page A-Z asset listing, the navigation character list displays links to the different alphabetised pages on the listing. This feature adds the ability to format the individual letters on this list.

This feature utilises the asset listing's existing Page Link and Current Link formats, which were not previously used on an A-Z asset listing.

On an A-Z listing, the Page Link Format will now define the layout of each individual letter on the linked character list, while the Current Page Format will define the layout of letters that contain no results.

These formats use the existing %page_link% and %page_number% keyword replacements. For example, you could format the letters on the list so that letters with results will be in bold, while letters with no results will be struck out.

The feature gives users greater control over the layout of their A-Z listings, in line with the options available on a regular asset listing.

Make SOAP Call on Submit Submission Action: Array Data in SOAP Response [ Feature Request #5127 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, the Custom Form's Make SOAP Call on Submit form submission action could not handle array data in the SOAP response. This feature adds support for array data in the SOAP response, populating array data into global keywords using index numbers.

For example:

%globals_session_[FOMR_ASSETID]_array_field0_value%, %globals_session_[FOMR_ASSETID]_array_field2_value%, %globals_session_[FOMR_ASSETID]_array_field3_value%

This feature also adds a TEST SOAP option to printout the sample SOAP request and response in the backend, for testing purposes.

Make SOAP Call on Submit Submission Action: Check SOAP Response [ Feature Request #5128 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This features introduces data validation on the SOAP request of the Make SOAP Call on Submit form submission action of a Custom Form. If incorrect data is found in the request, Matrix will respond with a suggestion of specific error message, while if no incorrect data is found, will process the request, as normal.  

This feature is implemented through a new Check Response function. This function will check specified fields on the SOAP response, printing an error message if a value is returned (non-empty). Field keywords are also available for use, allowing you to print any error messages returned on the SOAP response.

Returned errors are displayed to a user via the %form_errors% keyword replacement and the user will not progress to the next page of the form. If no errors are retrieved, the user will be able to continue their form submission. 

JSON Data Source
-----------------------------------------------------

This new JSON Data Source asset is an alternative to the existing XML Data Source, facilitating server-side data exchange with web applications.

Clean Old Shadow Links Script
-----------------------------------------------------

A new script has been added to the Matrix database to clean links to shadow assets that are no longer valid. This is usually because the assets have since been removed from the data source, e.g. An LDAP backend user is linked under the System Administrators folder but is later removed from the LDAP Directory.

Additional reasons a shadow link may no longer be valid is if the connection between Matrix and the data source goes down or if the configuration of the connection bridge is altered for testing purposes. Because of these reasons, when the clean_old_shadow_links.php script is first run, it will only return a list of shadow links for review. You can then decided whether or not to delete the shadow links in the system.

VERSION 4.2.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================


Version numbers in __data URLs [ Feature Request #4808 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

It's difficult to manage cache expiration of statically served content, since this content is served blind by apache.

That is, you can edit a file, or CSS asset for example, but until the browser forces the request of a new version (further compounded by reverse proxies), the old version will continue to be served.

A common pattern for dealing with this is to add version numbers to the URL for the static file. Often, this is simply added as a query string for simplicity.

The effect being, when the file is updated and you bust the cache on the page, the URL for the file is different (since it's versioned), and so the browser gets the fresh version of the asset.

This can be a huge boost in caching strategies, allowing people to be more aggressive with their cache policy and empowering them to bust the 'perceived' cache on static files more easily.

TRIM Feature Request for Cron Job [ Feature Request #4875 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Added ability to modify the (when) attribute of the saved search cron job through the details interface.

Also added a custom field in saved search to allow the result set to contain a text version of a records container called (Container Title)

	Remap Manager: Never Delete Enhancements [ Feature Request #4890 ]
	-----------------------------------------------------

	The Remap Manager's Never Delete option allows you to lock specific remaps from being deleted. This new feature improves this existing functionality by adding a variety of enhancements.

	A new option has been added to the Remap Manager to purge all remaps in the system except those marked as Never Delete. This option is enabled through a new field on the Details screen of the Remap Manager.

	Setting this field to Yes and clicking Commit will purge all remaps in the system that are not marked as Never Delete.

	The Web Paths screen of an asset would previously list its remaps but would provide no indication of whether the remap was marked as Never Delete or not. A new column has now been added for remaps on the Web Paths screen to display whether the remap is marked as Never Delete.

	Previously, delete fields were available to all remaps listed in the Remap Manager or on the Web Paths screens of assets. These fields were ineffective when used on remaps marked as Never Delete, however they were still accessible. These delete fields will now only be enabled for use on remaps not marked as Never Delete. The delete field will be disabled on remaps marked as Never Delete, as shown in the figure above.

	The Remap Manager's Never Delete Added Remaps? field will now be disabled by default, meaning that users must manually enable this option. This field was previously enabled by default; Existing installations using the previous default will retain their settings when being updating.

	Slight performance improvement in rebuilding cache [ Feature Request #4925 ]
	-----------------------------------------------------

	A slight performance improvement can be achieved by testing if the asset has no urls first up and finishing, since a url is needed to be indexed by funnelback.

	Improved permissions in Squiz Search [ Feature Request #4926 ]
	-----------------------------------------------------

	Improved permissions in Squiz Search will be handled by adding the systemid to all but the public key when retrieving the sitemap.
