PAGINATED FORM SUBMISSIONS

	Previously, all form submission were listed on the same page in the custom form. This caused errors when a large number of form submissions (> 10,000) were being displayed. The custom form now has a paginated interface for viewing form submissions, allowing the interface to cope with an unlimited number of submission for a single form.

WYSIWYG TABLE EDITOR IMPROVED

	The WYSIWYG table editor now has a number of new (widely requested) ways to edit HTML tables. While some are new pieces of functionality, the changes have been back-ported to the current stable branch to fix a number of bugs in the table editor that are stopping users from editing content.

	The new table editing functionality allows for:
	- the selection of row, cell, and column properties for modification (previously only row and cell were available)
	- there are options for the entire table such as border (both html and css), colour, caption and other functionality that was present in previous versions
	- each of the selectors now has their own panel that has the facility to edit the colour, size and border of the selected container, as well as the ability to add and delete elements
	- the table editor is now easier to use as it implements guideline borders for tables which would otherwise seem invisible

VERSION 3.4.0

Featured Changes
----------------------

New Global Web Folders

	Design linking changes introduced in 3.3.1 beta have meant have resulted in existing site designs requiring their own Site asset to be created to ensure all the images and files attached to the design still have a URL that can be used to access them. This required a new Site asset to be created and for administrators to move all the site designs under this Site.

	To make this process easier, there is a now a Design Folder asset that can be used to store site designs. The Design Folder sets a default URL when created, so any designs linked under it will be web accessible by default. URLs for the Design Folder can also be modified as required, like a normal site asset.

	In addition, two other web folders have been added. There is a User Folder in which to store users and user groups, and a Media Folder in which to store files and images. Like the Design Folder, all assets linked under these two folders will be web accessible by default.

Default Web Paths for Users

	hen created, User assets now have a default web path set so the asset is web accessible. This allows the details of the user account to be edited in the simple editing interface without the use of the Account Manager, allowing for the editing of user metadata (etc) to be edited using layouts.

VERSION 3.4.0 RC1

Featured Changes
----------------------

New User Agent Condition For Show If Design Area

	There is a new condition for Show_If design areas called User_Agent. The user agent condition allow you to conditionally display content based on the type of browser or operating system that a site visitor is viewing the site with. The condition makes use of the user agent string provided by the web browser. Note that the user agent string can be modified on some browsers and so is not guaranteed to always accurately reflect the browser or operating system the site visitor is using.

	One use of this new condition is to set the design for a site based on the browser type. The following example uses the new condition to set a low bandwidth design for Blackberry PDA users. It redirects Blackberry users, setting the design for the duration of their session.

	<MySource_AREA id_name="test_blackberry" design_area="show_if">
	   <MySource_SET name="condition" value="user_agent" />
	   <MySource_SET name="condition_user_agent" value="blackberry" />
	   <MySource_THEN>
		 <script language="Javascript">
		   document.location = "<MySource_PRINT id_name="__global__" var="asset_link"
		   start_query_string="true" append_query_string="true" />SQ_DESIGN_NAME=low_bandwidth&SQ_ACTION=set_design_name";
		 </script>
	   </MySource_THEN>
	</MySource_AREA>

VERSION 3.3.1 beta

Featured Changes
----------------------

No Upgrade Available

	MySource Matrix 3.3.1 beta includes significant changes to the database structure due to our commitment to add Oracle support to MySource Matrix. The database changes are the first step towards this goal. There is currently no upgrade script available for this version due to the large number of changes to be made during the upgrade.

	The 3.3.1 beta release is present here for evaluation purposes only. It contains a significant number of new features, so we encourage users to install this version for testing and evaluation, but not to attempt upgrades of current 3.2.x systems.

MySQL Support Dropped

	MySource Matrix 3.3.1 beta drops support for MySQL as part of our commitment to add Oracle support to MySource Matrix. The FAQ contains more information about why MySQL support is being dropped and when it will be reintroduced. New installs of MySource Matrix 3.3.1 beta will only work with PostgreSQL databases.

Speed Improvements

	MySource Matrix 3.3.1 beta contains a number of speed improvements over the current 3.2.x versions. A significant portion of development time for this release was put into tracking down and fixing slow queries and PHP code. We have added new indexes to the database, changed the way asset creation works, improved the loading of asset attributes, and added caching of installed asset types, all to improve the speed of the system.

	These changes will be most evident on larger systems, and have been targeted to improve the loading of the administration interface and decrease the time taken to create assets.

Internal Messages No Longer In Rollback

	To gain further speed improvements, it was necessary to remove internal messages from the rollback system. The result is that, when viewing the system in rollback view mode, internal messages will remain current and will not appear as they would have on the specified rollback date. No internal messages or logs will be lost as a result of this change.

Design Linking Changes

	When you link a design to a site or page, the design used to be TYPE_3 linked to the asset. TYPE_3 links don't appear in any menus, but they are still part of the asset tree. As a result, all status, schema, permission etc changes that occurred to a site or page would cascade to the design assets as well. This was generally unexpected behaviour. Designs are now NOTICE linked instead of TYPE_3 linked to stop the cascading of changes.

Disabled Buttons On Commit

	To reduce confusion, pressing a button that submits a form while editing (such as the Commit, Lock, or Release Locks(s) buttons) now disables all buttons in the editing interface. Previously, pressing a submit button twice produced a Javascript warning, letting the user know that the form has already been submitted. This new method makes this process less confusing for users.

WYSIWYG Now Works With Strict HTML

	A problem has existed with the WYSIWYG editor for a while where the toolbar is not displayed properly if a DOCTYPE is declared for the page. This occurred when the site's design was being painted instead of the administration design, such as when working in the simple editing interface or using the Asset Builder.

	The previous solution to this problem was to remove the DOCTYPE declaration from the design parse file, or use a different design while using the simple editing interface. The WYSIWYG has now been changed to stop this problem from occurring even if a DOCTYPE declaration is present.

Commit Button Text Now Configurable

	The commit buttons throughout the administration and simple editing interfaces are all labeled as "Commit". To aid in the customisation of the editing interfaces, the commit button text can now be set for the whole system. For example, you may wish to change the commit button to read "Save".

	A system administrator can change the commit button text through the System Configuration screen. The commit button options are listed at the bottom of this screen.

Support For Uploading Large Files

	MySource Matrix 3.3.1 beta contains a new data directory (MYSOURCE_ROOT/data/temp) where you can place large files and then upload them into your MySource Matrix system. Uploading large file via HTTP is a long process and often fails. This new system allows you to copy large files to the server and then have MySource Matrix import them directly into your system.

	For example, you can FTP a 20MB PDF document to the MYSOURCE_ROOT/data/temp directory and then select this file when creating a PDF asset in MySource Matrix. On the create screen of the PDF, simply select to use an uploaded files and select the name of the file from the dropdown displayed.

New Show If Design Area

	There is a new design area available in MySource Matrix 3.3.1 beta that allows you to conditionally display content. Content can be displayed based on if the visitor is logged in, if they are in the simple editing interface, or if they have write or administrator access to the asset.

	The following example shows how content can be displayed based on the logged in status of the visitor.

	<!-- display different content depending on whether the user is logged in or not -->
	<mysource_area id_name="logged_in_condition" design_area="show_if">
	  <mysource_set name="condition" value="logged_in" />
	  <mysource_then>
		You are logged in.
	  </mysource_then>
	  <mysource_else>
		You are NOT logged in.
	  </mysource_else>
	</mysource_area>

New Request Vars Design Area

	here is a new design area available in MySource Matrix 3.3.1 beta that allows you to access the contents of the GET, POST, and REQUEST arrays in the design.

	For example, to dynamically control the title of a page, you could use a GET variable that is passed on the query string of the URL. Consider the following example design area:

	<!-- this is declared at the top of the parse file -->
	<MySource_AREA id_name="get_vars" design_area="request_vars">
		<MySource_SET name="method" value="get" />
	</MySource_AREA>

	<!-- this is in the main body of the parse file -->
	<h1><MySource_PRINT id_name="get_vars" var="page_title" /></h1>
	If a user comes to this page with the URL: http://www.example.com/page?page_title=Testing
	The design would output the title as: <h1>Testing</h1>

Menu Design Area Changes

	The menu design area has a new option to customise linking within high accessibility menus. The new self_link option determines if the current asset should include a link to itself in the menu or if it should only display its name or short name. To use the self_link option, the new asset_name_linked and asset_short_name linked print vars must also be used.

	Consider the following example where the menu prints all pages but the current page has no <a> tags around it.

	<MySource_AREA id_name="menu" design_area="menu_normal">
	  <MySource_SET name="self_links" value="false" />
	  <MySource_ASSET>
		<MySource_PRINT var="asset_name_linked" />
	  </MySource_ASSET>
	</MySource_AREA>

New Calendar Package

	A new set of modules has been developed to add calendar functionality to MySource Matrix. The Calendar package is included in the commerically available modules package from Squiz.Net. For more information on the MySource Matrix Calendar package, or to purchase the commerical modules, please contact us.

New Lexicon Package

	A new set of modules has been developed to add thesaurus related functionality to MySource Matrix, including thesaurus based searching and abbreviation replacements in the WYSIWYG editor. The Lexicon package is included in the commerically available modules package from Squiz.Net. For more information on the MySource Matrix Lexicon package, or to purchase the commerical modules, please contact us.
