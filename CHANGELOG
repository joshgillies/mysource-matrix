MYSOURCE MATRIX CHANGELOG

VERSION 3.24.0

Featured Changes
-----------------------------------

iCal Data Source
	This new Data Source accepts a URL or server file supplied in iCal-format and exposes the events as shadow assets.
The Summary information of each event is used to name each event under the Data Source. This can then be used like other Data Source assets in Asset Listings. 


HIPO Job optimisations on Squiz Server
	The previous change to save progress information for HIPO Jobs run on Squiz Server every 1% has been removed. Progress information is now no longer saved for such jobs.


Log to System Log support
	A new option, "Log Errors To Syslog" has been added to System Configuration, to specify whether Matrix errors are to
also be logged to the operating system log. The "facility" used for logging can be specified here as well (ie; "User", or "Local 0..7").

The "System Name" will be used as a System Log identifier, but this will default to the Matrix system string "Squiz MySource [version] (Matrix)" if the name is not specified. 


Multiple E-Commerce Carts
	The E-Commerce Cart asset now stores contents per Checkout Page within the user session instead of just one system-wide cart.


Search Manager: Multi-Context Searching
	Context-aware data is now indexed and searches performed within a context now return results stored against that context.


Roles query optimisations
	Some further query optimisations have been accomplished which may increase general performance when Roles are enabled.

VERSION 3.24.0 RC1

Featured Changes
-----------------------------------

Global Keywords for cookie values
	A set of dynamic Global Keywords in the format %globals_cookie_XX% can now be used to return the value stored in the corresponding cookie variable. 


DataCash and SagePay Payment Gateways
	Support has been added for payments made via the DataCash and SagePay payment gateways.

The configuration of each gateway is similar to PayPal in that each requires PHP code from the respective gateway provider to be sourced independently and referenced in each Gateway asset.

A "Test Mode" switch and specification of card types which require 3DS authentication are among some of the options available in these Gateway assets.

These Gateway assets include support for the Address Verification Service (AVS) and Card Verification Value (CVV or CV2) security layers.
For the Sage Pay gateway, the "3-D Secure" layer of security is now optional.

Also, the "Pass-through Variables" features mentioned below are now handled by these two gateways. The supported pass-through variables are shown on the Details screen. Enter the variable names to be used on this screen, then match them with the variable keys entered on the E-Commerce Form Page's Ecommerce Rules screen.


DataCash Payment Gateway: Specification of Currency Type
	A currency type (eg; Australian Dollars) can now be specified on the "Details" screen of the DataCash Payment Gateway, as the currency used for transactions.


SagePay Gateway: Month/Year drop-downs
	New keywords have been added to show a drop-down to select card start and expiry dates. One keyword for month and one for year is available for each.

The year dropdown keywords support a modifier to set the number of years before the current date the start year drop-down should show, or after the current date the expiry year drop-down should show. By default, years are shown from the current year to 5 years backward or forward.


Design Area Condition: Asset Type
	A Design Area Condition "Asset Type" has been added to control content in a Design parse file depending on the exact type of an asset. Multiple asset types may be specified and this can be configured further or overridden under Design Customisations.


Support for class and ID attributes in WYSIWYG Anchor Links
	The "Status Text" item in the anchor pop-up has been replaced with two fields to control the CSS class and ID attributes for the link. 


Additional Asset Keywords in Metadata Fields
	The Asset-level keywords %asset_name_linked% and %asset_short_name_linked% are replaced in Metadata Field values where encountered. 


Asset Map Icon Keyword
	A Global and Asset-level keyword, %asset_type_icon% and %globals_icon_xx%, have been added which when used print the Asset Map icon of the current asset type, or that of a certain type (eg; %globals_icon_page_standard% for the Standard Page icon). 


User Locks Details
	The first 100 locks held by a user can now be determined from the "Details" screen of Matrix User asset types. 


Delete Bulkmail Users Tool: Enhancements and new related Trigger Action
	A new Trigger Action "Delete Bulkmail User" has been added. This is similar to the existing Delete Bulkmail Users Tool however accepts a comma-separated string of email addresses from which to operate.

An option to move Bulkmail Users that would have been deleted into a specified Folder or User Group is included in the new Trigger Action and added to the existing Delete Bulkmail Users Tool. 


E-Commerce Payment Completed Trigger Event
	A generic E-Commerce Payment Completed Trigger Event has been added to provide Trigger functionality for transaction postbacks. This has been implemented for transactions originating from a DataCash Payment Gateway. 


HIPO Job Optimisations on Squiz Server
	HIPO Jobs have been modified to save status information every 3% of the job's length. Progress information is now saved every 1%. These optimisations are only applicable when run on Squiz Server.

These changes reduce database queries performed during processing and should therefore increase performance of job processing for large jobs.


Negated Link Value Filtering for Asset Listings
	New attribute added that specifies if assets returned should match or be different to the supplied link value.


Keyword Replacements in Regular Expression Keyword Condition
	Asset-level keywords such as %asset_name% can now be used in the Regular Expression Keyword Condition. A new option, "Replace keywords in pattern", is provided to enable this functionality.


Send Email Trigger Action: Support for Global Keywords
	Global Keywords such as %globals_asset_xx% and %globals_site_xx% can now be used in the "From", "To", "Subject" and "Body" fields on the Send Email Trigger Action.


Modifications to Create Clone and Link to Asset Trigger Action
	It is now possible to link to and clone underneath the Broadcasting asset in this Trigger Action. 


System Config Option: Remove Self Links
	This new System Config setting allows you to remove links that point to the currently-displayed asset, when this config setting is enabled.

This is done at a global level, and also includes links with query strings, or special URL suffixes recognised by Matrix (such as the admin or simple edit interface suffixes).


Create Bodycopy Containers in Safe Edit
	Creation of Bodycopy DIVs and Tables in Safe Edit is now supported again. If the Safe Edit is cancelled, the containers created during Safe Edit are moved to the Trash.


New Trigger Action: Set Special Page
	This new trigger action allows you to set the firing asset as the specified "special page" - ie. Index Page, Not Found, or Archived Asset - of either the passed site asset, or all of the sites the firing asset is located.


Public User Session Created Trigger Event
	This new trigger event fires when the Public User session is first created. This allows trigger actions to be fired when a user first visits the site.


Send Email Action: New Dynamic Parameter
	The Send Email trigger action allows you to override the Asset to Send option with either the firing asset, or a value set from a Parameter Map. 


E-Commerce Form: Pass-through Variables
	The concept of "pass-through variables" has been added to the E-Commerce Rules screen of the E-Commerce Form asset. These variables are defined by the Payment Gateway, and the values of the questions can be passed to the gateway for use in processing, such as providing an address for Address Verification Service (AVS).

The following attributes have also been added to the Order asset.
They will be filled in if the Payment Gateway returns them:
	- Transaction ID
	- Billing Name
	- Billing Address
	- Delivery Name
	- Delivery Address


Manage Child Links on Linking Screen
	The Linking screen now contains a drop-down that allows you to switch between showing the parents of the current asset (as was previous functionality), and the children.

When the view is set to "Linked Children", the options allowing you to create and delete links also change, allowing you to manage an asset's child links instead of its parent links.

This change of setting is not saved, so the Linking screen will always default to showing an asset's parents.


XML Data Source improvements
	The following additions were made to the XML Data Source asset:

	- The concept of Dynamic Inputs, currently available in DB Data
	  Source, is now available. The Dynamic Inputs screen allows users
	  to create variables whose values are set through Parameter Map
	  settings. These can then be embedded into the XML Feed URL using
	  the format "%%VariableName%%".

	- You may now enclose selected tags in a CDATA section, if the
	  XML returned from the feed does not do that for you. The Details
	  screen accepts a comma-separated list of tags whose contents will
	  be wrapped in a CDATA section. These tags must already be defined
	  in the "Tag Names" list above it.

	- Feeds with multiple copies of a tag in a record are now supported.
	  The asset merges the copies together with a delimiter, which can
	  be specified on the Details screen. 


JS API Asset updates
	The JS API asset now supports a much larger range of actions, including asset creation, linking functions, locking, permissions and getting of parent/children. An asset can now be sent to the API using either asset ID or URL. The "General Info" function now includes an attribute for an asset's Web Path.

These further modifications were again graciously contributed by Nic Hubbard.


Delete Permission through Trigger Actions
	The Set Permission Trigger Action now allows you to remove a permission from an asset, alongside adding an "apply" or "deny" permission.


New Asset Type: "Donation" Product
	This new asset is a generic product-type asset that can be added to carts to represent a generic donation.


New Asset Type: Link
	This new asset represents a link to a URL or another asset. Unlike Redirect Page, this will not redirect when its contents are printed, but the link will be displayed instead. An optional Relation ("rel") attribute can be added to the link.


Backup Script modifications

	The "scripts/backup.sh" Matrix backup script now prints everything to STDERR (error output stream) instead of STDOUT.
The backup file generated is now compressed using gzip piping through tar, if supported by the system. The "cache" directory is now included in the backup but not its contents. Support has also been added for Solaris "/bin/sh" syntax.

An option has been added to the Matrix Backup Script - scripts/backup.sh - to allow a backup filename to be specified. For example, running the following command will create a backup file in the filesystem location /path/to/backup/folder/filename.tar.gz:

	./scripts/backup.sh /path/to/matrix /path/to/backup/folder filename.tar.gz

Please note that the backup folder must be included as the second argument otherwise the filename will be mistaken for the folder name. The file extension - either ".tar.gz" or ".tgz" - must be included in the filename otherwise the file will not be assigned an extension.


SOAP Server: Workflow operation changes in Workflow Service

	A new operation "SafeEditAsset" has been added to the Workflow Service in SOAP Server. This allows a Live asset to enter Safe Edit. It is also now possible to specify Workflow Messages for assets in Workflow via the "ApproveAssetInWorkflow" and "CompleteWorkflow" operations.
