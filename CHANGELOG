Featured Changes

New JavaScript API Functions: getLineageFromUrl, getUrlFromLineage [ Feature Request #5665 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Two new operations have been added to the JavaScript API's Traversing functionality.

The getLineageFromUrl() operation returns the asset lineage of a specified URL. This function differs from the existing getLineage() operation by returning the specific asset lineage of a URL rather than returning all lineages of the asset.

This operation take the following parameters.

asset_url: the URL of the asset to get the lineage of.
dataCallback: the custom callback function. 

An example usage of this operation is as follows:

Standard Mode:

getLineageFromUrl("http://www.example.com/site",  customDataCallbackFunc); 

Enhanced Mode:

js_api.getLineageFromUrl({
  "asset_url":"http://www.example.com/site",
  "dataCallback":customDataCallbackFunc
}) 

The getUrlFromLineage() operation returns the URL of a specified asset lineage.

This operation takes the following parameters:

lineage: an array of asset IDs in lineage order, e.g. ["80", "85", "200"] or [{"assetid":"80"}, {"assetid":"85"}, {"assetid":"200"}].
root_url: a root URL to filter the results against multiple roots (optional).
protocol: a protocol to filter the results, e.g. http, https (optional).
dataCallback: the custom callback function. 

An example usage of this operation is as follows:

Standard Mode:

getUrlFromLineage(["4206", "4437"], "", "https", customDataCallbackFunc);

Enhanced Mode:

js_api.getUrlFromLineage({
  "lineage":["4206", "4437"],
  "protocol":"https",
  "dataCallback":customDataCallbackFunc
})

Automatic Upgrade Script: Display Upgrade Steps [ Feature Request #5550 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Enhancements have been made to Squiz Matrix's Automatic Upgrade Script to allow users to view the upgrade steps of specific versions of Matrix without requiring that particular instance.

Previously, users could use the --verbose parameter on the script to display a full list of upgrade steps from their current version to the version of Matrix indicated.

This enhancement introduces a new --show_steps parameter, which allows users to specify two versions of Matrix to view a full list of upgrade steps between them.

Usage of this script parameter is shown below. Please note that the database type (psql or oci) must be specified when using this parameter.

php matrix_upgrade.php --show_steps mysource_4-2-2 mysource_4-8-0 psql

php matrix_upgrade.php --show_steps mysource_4-2-2 mysource_4-8-0 oci

VERSION 4.6.3

Featured Changes
===================================


Cache Manager: Additional Send Cacheable Header Settings  [ Feature Request #5409 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, Squiz Matrix did not send cacheable headers for SSL encrypted requests.

This feature addresses this issue by adding new settings to the Cache Manager's Send Cacheable Header screen, allowing you to specify the protocol when cacheable headers will be sent (HTTP, HTTPS or both). Additional options allow you to configure the cache-control level for both HTTP and HTTPS protocols.

WYSIWYG Insert Link Tool: Direct Links to Asset External Target URLs [ Feature Request #5517 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The WYSIWYG's Insert Link tool allows you to insert a hyperlink to an external site or an internal asset. Previously, however, this tool, when creating links to Link and Redirect Page assets, would create a link directly to that asset (e.g. "./?a=123").

This features introduces new functionality that allows you to link directly to the target URLs of Link and Redirect Page assets.

A new Asset Type field has been added to the Insert Link tool. This field allows you to specify whether the link is to a Link or Redirect Page asset or, if not, any other asset.

When a user selects ether the Link Asset or Redirect Page Asset options, only assets of those types will be able to be selected in the Select Asset field. Once an asset is selected, and a global keyword replacement will be automatically printed in the Link field, linking directly to the target URL of the asset, as follows: 

	- %globals_asset_attribute_link_url:123%
	- %glob als_asset_attribute_redirect_url:123%  

This feature has been added to aid editors and simply the process of linking to external urls on Matrix assets.

-----------------------------------------------------

The Select question type, used on a Custom Form, allows you to specify a CSV file from your computer to automatically input the options for the select question. This is useful for batch uploading a number of options or if you are importing an existing question's options.

Previously, this functionality was not available on the Metadata Select Field. This feature introduces this addition, allowing you to specify a CSV file when configuring the Metadata Select Field's options.

Keyword Modifiers Available on Page Contents Bodycopies [ Feature Request #5138 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Keyword replacements within Squiz Matrix can be modified using a variety of keyword modifiers to further configure the returned values. For example, the keyword %asset_contents^maxwords:10% uses the maxwords modifier to display the first ten words of the body of the asset.

Previously, keyword modifiers were not available for use on the Page Contents and Page Contents (No Results) bodycopies of Asset Listing and Search Page assets.

This feature allows keyword modifiers to be used on these bodycopies, enabling the further configuration of your Asset Listings and Search pages.

VERSION 4.6.0

Featured Changes
===================================


Script to Export Form Submissions to CSV [ Feature Request #5337 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

A new script has been added to allow users to export form submissions to CSV. This script can be set to run automatically at regular intervals and is useful for integrating submissions into other systems.

The export_form_submission_logs.php script takes the following arguments:

- The asset ID of the form to export the submissions of.
- A date range of submissions to export.
- The path of the CSV file to export submissions to.

An example of its usage is shown below:

php scripts/export_form_submission_logs.php $PWD 1234 "yesterday 00:00:00" "yesterday 23:59:59" >~/submissions-export.csv

Save File Response on Make SOAP Call Form and Trigger Action [ Feature Request #5356 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The Make SOAP Call action sends a message to a remote SOAP server on the submission of a form or when a trigger is fired.

Previously, this action was unable to save files that were returned as values on the SOAP response. This feature adds the ability to temporary download any files returned on the SOAP response.

A new Response to download as file field on the Make SOAP Call settings allows you to specify the corresponding field keyword(s) of the file(s) on the SOAP response.

When a file is returned on the SOAP response, Squiz Matrix will temporarily store this file on the server, replacing the field keyword with a relative URL to retrieve the file.

A new Remove SOAP Response Files Cron Job is included with this feature. Set to run hourly, this cron job will clear the temporary files of SOAP responses stored on the server.

Please note that this feature applies to the Make SOAP Call trigger action, form submission action and form step action.

Upload YouTube Video Custom Form Submission Action [ Feature Request #5383 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Submission actions on a Custom Form allow you to create custom actions that will be performed whenever a submission is made. This could involve, for example, sending an email, performing a database query or making a SOAP call.

This feature introduces a new submission action to the Custom Form -- the Upload YouTube Video submission action. This submission action will take a video file on the submission and upload it to YouTube.

OAuth authentication is granted via a YouTube-linked Google Account, allowing videos in submissions to be automatically uploaded to YouTube.

You can specify the privacy setting of uploaded videos (public, private or unlisted) and provide default settings for the video, including the title, description and category. In addition to these default settings, you can specify the questions on your form to use submission responses as the details for the uploaded video. An upload file question type is specified as the source of the video to upload.

Accompanying this new submission action, a number of new keyword replacements are available for use on the Thank You bodycopy:

- %youtube_video_id%: the ID of the uploaded video. This ID is used within the YouTube link of the uploaded file (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxxx).
- %youtube_video_published_date%: the publish date of the YouTube video (yyyy-mm-dd).
- %youtube_video_link%: the full link of the uploaded YouTube video.

Permission Keyword Replacements to Print User IDs [ Feature Request #5399 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

New keyword replacements have been added to print a comma-separated list of asset IDs of users with Read, Write and Admin permissions on an asset.

%asset_read_permission_assetid%
%asset_write_permission_assetid%
%asset_admin_permission_assetid%

This is similar to the existing permission keywords that allow you to print the full name and email of users with permissions. For more information on these keywords, refer to the Squiz Matrix User Manual Library.

VERSION 4.6.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================


Remove Trailing Slash Off Requested URLs and Redirect [ Feature Request #5138 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Within Matrix, a URL with or without a trailing slash will render the same content. As the Cache Manager treats every URL uniquely, however, Matrix would previously end up caching both of these URLs, resulting in two separate cache entries for the same content.

This feature strips the trailing slash off such front-end requested URLs and redirect them, resulting in just one cache entry for the URL content.

Please note that this feature does not apply to root URLs due to the possibility of apache being configured to append the trailing slash. 

Global Preference to Restrict Assets Created Under Specified Sites as Type 2 Linked [ Feature Request #5161 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The new 'Child Creation Type 2 Link Restriction' global preference allows users to specify site assets to restrict newly created children to TYPE 2 links only. This means that any newly created assets under these sites (at any depth) will only be able to be created as TYPE 2 linked assets.

The link type of these assets can still be changed after asset creation via the asset's Linking screen.


New Script to Evaluate and Fix Files in the Public Data Directory [ Feature Request #5171 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Matrix's public data directory houses File assets on the Matrix system that are publicly accessible (live with public read access). However, in some cases this directory may be missing files or contain old or private files due to file system permission problems and other issues.

This feature introduces the system_integrity_fix_public_files.php script. When run, this script will update any out-of-date files on the public data directory, create any files that are missing from the directory and remove any files that are private and should not be in the directory.

Usage of this script is as follows:

$ php system_integrity_fix_public_files.php SYSTEM_ROOT ROOT_ID 

System Integrity Clean Invalid Links Script [ Feature Request #5175 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's system_integrity_orphaned_assets.php script finds and links orphaned assets underneath a specified asset ID. It also takes care of invalid links, where the major ID in a link is a missing asset; it does not, however, cater for when the child minor ID is missing while the major ID still exists.

This feature introduces the system_integrity_invalid_links.php script. This script will remove significant links where one or both sides of a link does not exist. This script will also report on the number of orphaned assets in the system and may recommend running the system_integrity_orphaned_assets.php script, upon its completion.

New Keyword Modifier to Apply XSLT to XML Content [ Feature Request #5183 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Keyword modifiers allow you to modify keyword replacements to further configure their returned values. This feature adds a new keyword modifier to apply XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) to XML content returned on the keyword.

The format for this keyword modifier is as follows.

%keyword^xslt:<assetid>%
 
%asset_contents_raw^xslt:343% 

This modifier will take the XSLT of a file asset (specified by asset ID), apply it to XML returned on the asset and output the result.

This feature has been added to allow users to transform the XML of assets, providing greater control over the content of their sites.

New System Forking Scripts [ Feature Request #5294 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This feature adds three forking scripts, aimed to increase the performance of these scripts and prevent memory leakage, especially on larger systems where memory usage is otherwise too high and/or performance of single-threaded scripts is too slow.

The scripts added are:

system_apply_permissions.php : takes a permission string in a specific format that allows you to run multiple permission operations on the specified asset and their children. This script forks and runs in batches to curb memory usage and also runs multiple threads in parallel to speed up the overall operation.

system_apply_metadata_schema.php : applies a metadata schema to the specified assets and their children (and generates the metadata for that asset). Runs in batches and multiple threads in parallel.

system_update_lookups.php : updates lookups for all assets under the specified root node. Forks and runs in batches to keep memory usage down.


%asset_contents_paint_X% on Paint Layout Bodycopy [ Feature Request #5323 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

The %asset_contents_paint_X% keyword replacement is used on an Asset Listing Page to print the content of an asset with a specified Paint Layout applied. For example, the keyword %asset_contents_paint_1234% would apply the layout of asset #1234 to the asset content.

This feature enables the use of this keyword replacement for use within a Paint Layout bodycopy. This can be useful, for example, when using Conditional Keywords, to print the asset content with other Paint Layouts applied, based on the conditions specified.

This feature has been added to aid in the implementation of Paint Layouts, providing users with more flexibility and control over their content.

VERSION 4.4.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================


Logout Due to IP Change Logged in System Logs [ Feature Request #4604 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, when a user was logged out of Squiz Matrix because their IP changed and SQ_CONF_ALLOW_IP_CHANGE was set to true, neither an error or a system.security.* message would be sent. This meant that the only way to figure out why users were intermittently losing their session was to have prior knowledge of this setting.

This feature had been added so that Matrix will log logouts due to IP changing in the system logs. For example:

[2011-05-23 15:11:23][12:Root User][1024:mysource notice][ ] [system.security.logout.ip_change - remote_addr:192.168.1.1;sessionid:;] (User Automatically Logged Out) - User "Root User" was logged out since their IP address changed from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.1.1.

Enhancements to the import_files_from_bridge.php Script [ Feature Request #5033 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's import_files_from_bridge.php script imports files exposed through a File Bridge asset into Matrix. Previously, this script would import these files as File type assets; however, files will now be imported as corresponding Matrix file assets, when available. For example, an image will now be imported as an Image type asset. 

This feature also introduces the option of importing folders containing an index.html file as a Standard Page asset with the content of the index file. This option can be enabled by setting a parameter on the script.

The new usage of the import_files_from_bridge.php script is as follows:

php import_files_from_bridge.php <MATRIX_ROOT> <BRIDGE_ROOT_NODE_ASSETID> <PARENT_ASSETID> <RECURSIVE> <HANDLE_INDEX_FILE>
 
php import_files_from_bridge.php path/to/matrix 100 150 y y

Make SOAP Call Step Action For Multi-Page Forms [ Feature Request #5089 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Currently, Squiz Matrix's Custom Form asset allows you to make a SOAP call on submission. This new feature extends the functionality of submission actions to the individual steps (or pages) of a multi-page Custom Form, allowing your form to make a SOAP call on each page submission.

Step actions can be configured on the new Step Actions screen for form sections.

The set up of the Make SOAP Call step action is similar to the Make SOAP Call submission action, allowing you to specify the connection to the SOAP server and specify the request message.

On the front end of the form, when a user clicks the Next Page button, Squiz Matrix will make the SOAP call, as configured on the Step Actions screen for that step.

The Make SOAP Call step action also utilises the new Check Response function. This function will check specified fields on the SOAP response, printing an error message if a value is returned (non-empty). Field keywords are also available for use, allowing you to print any error messages returned on the SOAP response.

Returned errors are displayed to a user via the %form_errors% keyword replacement and the user will not progress to the next page of the form. If no errors are retrieved, the user will be able to continue their form submission. 

SharePoint CMIS Bridge [ Feature Request #5090 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This new feature introduces the CMIS Bridge asset, a connection bridge for retrieving files from a CMIS enabled SharePoint repository (currently supports Microsoft SharePoint 2010).

This asset retrieves SharePoint documents in a similar manner to the SharePoint Saved Search; however, files imported over the CMIS Bridge will be imported as fully functional system assets within Squiz Matrix (such as Images, Text Files etc.). These assets can be edited, linked and moved around the system just like any other asset, allowing you greater control over your SharePoint repositories within Matrix. 

Files are stored under the CMIS Bridge asset in the asset map when initially synchronised with the connected CMIS enabled SharePoint repository. Further synchronisation will update these files, trashing any old files, modifying files that have been altered and creating new assets for new files on the repository.

Synchronisation is also controlled via a new Sync CMIS Bridges Cron Job. This cron job is set to run daily - its run time and frequency can be configured on its Details screen.

CMIS properties (e.g. Author, Objectid, Modified, Created) can be mapped to the metadata fields of a schema applied to the CMIS Bridge. Additional custom fields created for the document library will dynamically be made available for metadata mapping.

The addition of this asset enhances the SharePoint package within Squiz Matrix, allowing you to manage your SharePoint documents within Matrix with more control than ever before.

Search Page: Specify Data Sources on Exclude Fields [ Feature Request #5094 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, Matrix's Search Page only allowed you to configure data sources for search fields. The data sources allowed you to specify which fields on an asset to search. This feature extends this functionality to exclude fields, allowing you to specify which fields to exclude on.

Like a search field, exclude fields allow the following data source types:

Include All: searches all standard fields, attribute fields and metadata fields of assets.
Standard Asset Field: searches a specified standard asset field (e.g. the name of a page or its asset ID).
Asset Attribute: searches a specified attribute field (e.g. the title of a file of a MS Word Document asset).
Asset Metadata Field: searches a specified metadata field.

You can select multiple data sources to search for each exclude field that you add, specifying the word logic to use for your data sources (all words or any word).

Please note that existing exclude fields will default to the Include All data source type, returning the same results as they would previously had.

On the Search Page, the exclude field will only search the fields specified in its data sources. For example, say you configure the exclude field to search the Keywords metadata field of assets - if a user searches for the query News in the exclude field, the Search Page will exclude assets contain the query News in their Keywords metadata from the search results.

This enhancement to the Search Page's exclude fields allows you to tweak your Search Page, allowing your users to return more accurate results, specific to their searching queries.

Specifiying the Cron Deadlock Email Notification Receivers [ Feature Request #5103 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Squiz Matrix's Cron Manager handles the cron process within a system, managing and running the cron jobs that have been scheduled. Occasionally, a cron job may stall, causing the Cron Manager to deadlock. When this occurs, Matrix will send out email notifications, informing users of these errors.

Previously, Matrix would send these deadlock email notifications to all users under the System Administrators Folder, as well as the email addresses configured in the system's main.inc file. These automated email notifications would be resent to these users each subsequent run of the Cron Manager, until the issue was resolved. This could cause large numbers of emails sent to many users, potentially causing inconvenience and even spam filtering issues with users' mail clients.

This feature adds a new option to the Cron Manager, allowing you to specify the users that will receive cron deadlock emails. This option is configured via a new Emailing Options section on the Options screen of the Cron Manager.

The Cron Deadlock Email Receivers field allows you to select users, user groups and roles to specify which users should receive email notifications from the Cron Manager. By default, the system's Root User and the email addresses configured in the system's main.inc file will automatically also receive these emails.

By allowing you to specify the users to receive cron deadlock emails, this feature allows you to more efficiently identify and manage any potential issues with the Cron Manager in your system.

A-Z Listing: Defining the Layout of Individual Letters on the Navigation List [ Feature Request #5124 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

On a multiple page A-Z asset listing, the navigation character list displays links to the different alphabetised pages on the listing. This feature adds the ability to format the individual letters on this list.

This feature utilises the asset listing's existing Page Link and Current Link formats, which were not previously used on an A-Z asset listing.

On an A-Z listing, the Page Link Format will now define the layout of each individual letter on the linked character list, while the Current Page Format will define the layout of letters that contain no results.

These formats use the existing %page_link% and %page_number% keyword replacements. For example, you could format the letters on the list so that letters with results will be in bold, while letters with no results will be struck out.

The feature gives users greater control over the layout of their A-Z listings, in line with the options available on a regular asset listing.

Make SOAP Call on Submit Submission Action: Array Data in SOAP Response [ Feature Request #5127 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Previously, the Custom Form's Make SOAP Call on Submit form submission action could not handle array data in the SOAP response. This feature adds support for array data in the SOAP response, populating array data into global keywords using index numbers.

For example:

%globals_session_[FOMR_ASSETID]_array_field0_value%, %globals_session_[FOMR_ASSETID]_array_field2_value%, %globals_session_[FOMR_ASSETID]_array_field3_value%

This feature also adds a TEST SOAP option to printout the sample SOAP request and response in the backend, for testing purposes.

Make SOAP Call on Submit Submission Action: Check SOAP Response [ Feature Request #5128 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

This features introduces data validation on the SOAP request of the Make SOAP Call on Submit form submission action of a Custom Form. If incorrect data is found in the request, Matrix will respond with a suggestion of specific error message, while if no incorrect data is found, will process the request, as normal.  

This feature is implemented through a new Check Response function. This function will check specified fields on the SOAP response, printing an error message if a value is returned (non-empty). Field keywords are also available for use, allowing you to print any error messages returned on the SOAP response.

Returned errors are displayed to a user via the %form_errors% keyword replacement and the user will not progress to the next page of the form. If no errors are retrieved, the user will be able to continue their form submission. 

JSON Data Source
-----------------------------------------------------

This new JSON Data Source asset is an alternative to the existing XML Data Source, facilitating server-side data exchange with web applications.

Clean Old Shadow Links Script
-----------------------------------------------------

A new script has been added to the Matrix database to clean links to shadow assets that are no longer valid. This is usually because the assets have since been removed from the data source, e.g. An LDAP backend user is linked under the System Administrators folder but is later removed from the LDAP Directory.

Additional reasons a shadow link may no longer be valid is if the connection between Matrix and the data source goes down or if the configuration of the connection bridge is altered for testing purposes. Because of these reasons, when the clean_old_shadow_links.php script is first run, it will only return a list of shadow links for review. You can then decided whether or not to delete the shadow links in the system.

VERSION 4.2.0 RC1

Featured Changes
===================================


Version numbers in __data URLs [ Feature Request #4808 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

It's difficult to manage cache expiration of statically served content, since this content is served blind by apache.

That is, you can edit a file, or CSS asset for example, but until the browser forces the request of a new version (further compounded by reverse proxies), the old version will continue to be served.

A common pattern for dealing with this is to add version numbers to the URL for the static file. Often, this is simply added as a query string for simplicity.

The effect being, when the file is updated and you bust the cache on the page, the URL for the file is different (since it's versioned), and so the browser gets the fresh version of the asset.

This can be a huge boost in caching strategies, allowing people to be more aggressive with their cache policy and empowering them to bust the 'perceived' cache on static files more easily.

TRIM Feature Request for Cron Job [ Feature Request #4875 ]
-----------------------------------------------------

Added ability to modify the (when) attribute of the saved search cron job through the details interface.

Also added a custom field in saved search to allow the result set to contain a text version of a records container called (Container Title)

	Remap Manager: Never Delete Enhancements [ Feature Request #4890 ]
	-----------------------------------------------------

	The Remap Manager's Never Delete option allows you to lock specific remaps from being deleted. This new feature improves this existing functionality by adding a variety of enhancements.

	A new option has been added to the Remap Manager to purge all remaps in the system except those marked as Never Delete. This option is enabled through a new field on the Details screen of the Remap Manager.

	Setting this field to Yes and clicking Commit will purge all remaps in the system that are not marked as Never Delete.

	The Web Paths screen of an asset would previously list its remaps but would provide no indication of whether the remap was marked as Never Delete or not. A new column has now been added for remaps on the Web Paths screen to display whether the remap is marked as Never Delete.

	Previously, delete fields were available to all remaps listed in the Remap Manager or on the Web Paths screens of assets. These fields were ineffective when used on remaps marked as Never Delete, however they were still accessible. These delete fields will now only be enabled for use on remaps not marked as Never Delete. The delete field will be disabled on remaps marked as Never Delete, as shown in the figure above.

	The Remap Manager's Never Delete Added Remaps? field will now be disabled by default, meaning that users must manually enable this option. This field was previously enabled by default; Existing installations using the previous default will retain their settings when being updating.

	Slight performance improvement in rebuilding cache [ Feature Request #4925 ]
	-----------------------------------------------------

	A slight performance improvement can be achieved by testing if the asset has no urls first up and finishing, since a url is needed to be indexed by funnelback.

	Improved permissions in Squiz Search [ Feature Request #4926 ]
	-----------------------------------------------------

	Improved permissions in Squiz Search will be handled by adding the systemid to all but the public key when retrieving the sitemap.
