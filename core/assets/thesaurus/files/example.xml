Implicit declaration:
	The first use of a term or relation declares existence in the tree

Null relations:
	If a term tag appears within a term tag without a relation tag it is
	assumed to have a null relation, that is, one with an empty string
	for a name.

Incremental term declaration:
	A term may appear more than once in a document. Successive instances
	of a term will append new relations to the internal representation of
	that term

Looping:
	Trees containing loops are considered valid.
