	<section name="Authentication Redirects">
		<note>This section allows you, as an alternative to displaying a login box, to attempt a redirect from one URL to another in an attempt to be authenticated by some external mechanism. If the second URL provides some form of HTTP-based or other external authentication (whether by the web server itself, or by a proxy server, or by other means), then this may be useful to you. The redirection will continue in a chain (eg. a set up of URL &quot;A =&gt; B, B =&gt; C&quot; will redirect first to B, and then to C unless authentication occurred at URL &quot;B&quot;). If you are taken to a URL in the chain with no redirect defined, you will then receive a login box if still not authenticated.</note>
